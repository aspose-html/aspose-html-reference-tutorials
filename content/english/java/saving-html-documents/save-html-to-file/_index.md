## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to save an HTML document to a file while managing linked resources. This is particularly useful when you're working on projects that involve multiple HTML files—think of it like a web page that references other web pages. By the end of this guide, you’ll be equipped to use Aspose.HTML for Java to manage your HTML documents flexibly and efficiently.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, there are a few things you'll need to have in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have the JDK installed on your machine. Version 8 or above is recommended. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: You need to download the Aspose.HTML library. You can get it from the  releases page [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
3. IDE or Text Editor: You can use any IDE or text editor you prefer for Java development. IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or even a simple editor like Notepad++ will do fine.
4. Basic Knowledge of Java: Familiarity with Java programming basics will be helpful. You'll need to understand how to work with files and handle exceptions.
With everything set up, let’s move on to the fun part—the coding!
## Import Packages
To use Aspose.HTML, you need to import the required packages into your Java project. Here’s how you can do that:
### Include Aspose Dependencies
If you are using Maven, you can add the Aspose.HTML dependency in your `pom.xml` file. Here’s the Maven syntax:
```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
   <artifactId>aspose-html</artifactId>
   <version>{latest_version}</version>
</dependency>
```
Make sure to replace `{latest_version}` with the actual version number available from the Aspose downloads page.
### Import Statements in Your Java File
You’ll also need to include the relevant import statements at the beginning of your Java file:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Preparing the Output Path
First, you need to specify where your document will be saved. You can do this by defining a file path in your code.
```java
String documentPath = "save-with-linked-file.html";
```
Here, we are naming our main HTML document `save-with-linked-file.html`.
## Step 2: Creating the Main HTML File
Next, you'll want to create your main HTML file, which will link to another document. This is where we write the HTML content.
```java
java.nio.file.Files.write(java.nio.file.Paths.get(documentPath), "<p>Hello World!</p><a href='linked.html'>linked file</a>".getBytes());
```
In this step, we are creating a simple HTML structure with a paragraph and a link to another HTML document `linked.html`.
## Step 3: Creating the Linked HTML File
Now, let’s also create the linked HTML file that we mentioned in the previous step.
```java
java.nio.file.Files.write(java.nio.file.Paths.get("linked.html"), "<p>Hello linked file!</p>".getBytes());
```
This creates an HTML file that will display when you click on the link from your main document.
## Step 4: Loading the HTML Document into Memory
Once both files are created, the next step is to load your main HTML document into memory to work with it programmatically.
```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument(documentPath);
```
With this command, we are initializing an `HTMLDocument` object that you can manipulate in the next steps.
## Step 5: Creating Save Options
Before saving your document, it's crucial to configure how it should be saved. This involves creating an instance of `HTMLSaveOptions`.
```java
com.aspose.html.saving.HTMLSaveOptions options = new com.aspose.html.saving.HTMLSaveOptions();
```
## Step 6: Configuring Resource Handling Options
This part is critical if you have linked files. You must decide whether to include them in your output or exclude them. 
```java
options.getResourceHandlingOptions().setMaxHandlingDepth(1);
```
Setting the `MaxHandlingDepth` to `1` ensures that the linked document is not saved along with your main document. Change this value to include linked HTML files as needed.
## Step 7: Saving the Document
Finally, it’s time to save your document using the configured options.
```java
document.save("save-with-linked-file_out.html", options);
```
Here, we save the main document as `save-with-linked-file_out.html`, applying our specified options to the saving process.

This API is not only powerful but also easy to integrate into your projects, making HTML handling a breeze. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, Aspose.HTML for Java has features that can significantly enhance your workflow.
