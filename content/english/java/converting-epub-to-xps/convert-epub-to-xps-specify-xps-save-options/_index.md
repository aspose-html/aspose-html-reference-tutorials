In the world of web development, the ability to convert EPUB files to XPS format is a valuable tool. Aspose.HTML for Java is a powerful library that offers the capability to perform this conversion with ease. In this comprehensive tutorial, we will guide you through the process of specifying XPS save options for EPUB to XPS using Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

2. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: Download and install Aspose.HTML for Java from the official [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

3. EPUB File: You will need an EPUB file that you want to convert to XPS.

Now that we have our prerequisites in place, let's move on to the steps required to specify XPS save options for EPUB to XPS.

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.HTML for Java. You can do this by adding the following code at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import com.aspose.html.saving.XpsSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.html.rendering.PageSetup;
import com.aspose.html.drawing.Page;
import com.aspose.html.drawing.Size;
import com.aspose.html.drawing.Length;
import com.aspose.html.drawing.Color;
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
import com.aspose.html.system.io.resources.Resources;
```

## Open the EPUB File

Begin by opening an existing EPUB file for reading. You can use the following code snippet:

```java
try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(Resources.input("input.epub"))) {
    // Your code for the EPUB file handling goes here.
}
```

## Create XPS Save Options

Next, create an instance of the XpsSaveOptions with custom page size and background color. This is done by configuring the PageSetup and options. Here's how you can achieve this:

```java
XpsSaveOptions options = new XpsSaveOptions();
PageSetup pageSetup = new PageSetup();
Page anyPage = new Page();
anyPage.setSize(new Size(Length.fromPixels(3000), Length.fromPixels(1000)));
pageSetup.setAnyPage(anyPage);
options.setPageSetup(pageSetup);
options.setBackgroundColor(Color.getAliceBlue());
```

## Convert EPUB to XPS

Finally, you need to call the `convertEPUB` method to perform the EPUB to XPS conversion. Here's the code for that:

```java
Converter.convertEPUB(
    fileInputStream,
    options,
    Resources.output("output.xps")
);
```

With these steps in place, you can now easily specify XPS save options for EPUB to XPS conversion using Aspose.HTML for Java. This tutorial has provided you with a comprehensive guide, and by following these steps, you can seamlessly work with EPUB files and transform them into the XPS format.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have walked you through the process of specifying XPS save options for EPUB to XPS conversion using Aspose.HTML for Java. With the right prerequisites and the step-by-step guide, you can efficiently harness the power of this library for your web development projects.
