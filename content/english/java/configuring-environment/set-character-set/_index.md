## Introduction
If you're working with HTML documents in Java, ensuring the correct character set is crucial for proper encoding and rendering of text. In this guide, we’ll explore how to set the character set using Aspose.HTML for Java. This comprehensive tutorial will walk you through every step of the process, providing a clear understanding of how to handle character sets effectively.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the code, let's make sure you have everything set up:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have JDK installed. If not, you can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Aspose.HTML for Java: You need to download and install Aspose.HTML for Java. You can get it from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other Java-supporting IDE.

## Import Packages
Before writing the code, you need to import the necessary packages:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
```
These imports include all the essential classes you’ll need for setting up the character set, manipulating the HTML document, and converting it to a PDF.

## Step 1: Create the HTML Code
First, you’ll need some HTML content that you want to process. This example will demonstrate how to create a simple HTML file in Java.
```java
String code = "<h1>Character Set</h1>\r\n" +
    "<p>The <b>CharSet</b> property sets the primary character-set for a document.</p>\r\n";
try (java.io.FileWriter fileWriter = new java.io.FileWriter("document.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(code);
}
```

- HTML Content: The `code` variable holds a string that represents a basic HTML structure. It includes a heading (`<h1>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`).
- FileWriter: The `FileWriter` class is used to write the HTML code to a file named `document.html`. This file will be the starting point for our further manipulations.
## Step 2: Configure the Character Set
Once the HTML file is ready, the next step is to set up the character set using Aspose.HTML for Java.
```java
// Create an instance of Configuration
Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
```

- Configuration: The `Configuration` class is used to initialize the settings for your HTML document. This will allow you to customize various aspects, including the character set.
## Step 3: Access and Modify the User Agent Service
The character set can be defined through the `IUserAgentService` interface provided by Aspose.HTML.

```java
try {
    // Get the IUserAgentService
    IUserAgentService userAgent = configuration.getService(IUserAgentService.class);
    // Set ISO-8859-1 encoding to parse the document
    userAgent.setCharSet("ISO-8859-1");
```

- IUserAgentService: This service allows you to manage various settings related to the user agent, including the character set.
- setCharSet: The `setCharSet` method is used to specify the character encoding. In this example, we’re setting it to `ISO-8859-1`, which is a standard character encoding scheme.
## Step 4: Initialize the HTML Document
With the character set configured, you can now create an HTML document object that uses these settings.

```java
    // Initialize an HTML document with the specified configuration
    HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument("document.html", configuration);
```

- HTMLDocument: The `HTMLDocument` class represents the HTML document in your application. It takes the path to the HTML file and the configuration object as parameters. This ensures that the document is parsed using the specified character set.
## Step 5: Convert HTML to PDF
The final step is converting your HTML document to a PDF file. This is where the true power of Aspose.HTML for Java comes into play.

```java
    try {
        // Convert HTML to PDF
        Converter.convertHTML(
                document,
                new PdfSaveOptions(),
                "user-agent-charset_out.pdf"
        );
    } finally {
        if (document != null) {
            document.dispose();
        }
    }
} finally {
    if (configuration != null) {
        configuration.dispose();
    }
}
```

- Converter.convertHTML: This method converts the HTML document to a PDF. The `PdfSaveOptions` class is used to specify any PDF-specific settings.
- File Handling: The `dispose` method ensures that resources are released once the operation is complete, preventing memory leaks and other potential issues.

## Conclusion
And there you have it! You've successfully learned how to set the character set in Aspose.HTML for Java and convert an HTML document to a PDF. Whether you're working on internationalization or just ensuring your documents render correctly, understanding how to manage character sets is essential.

## FAQ's
### What is a character set, and why is it important?  
A character set determines how characters are represented in a document. It's crucial for proper text encoding, especially when dealing with multiple languages.
### Can I use a different character set than ISO-8859-1?  
Absolutely! Aspose.HTML for Java supports various character sets. You can set it according to your needs using the `setCharSet` method.
### Is it possible to convert other formats besides PDF?  
Yes, Aspose.HTML for Java allows you to convert HTML to various formats, including XPS, DOCX, and image formats like JPEG and PNG.
### Do I need to handle resource cleanup manually?  
While Java does have a garbage collector, it’s a good practice to manually release resources like configurations and documents using the `dispose` method.
### Where can I get a free trial of Aspose.HTML for Java?  
You can download a free trial from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/).
