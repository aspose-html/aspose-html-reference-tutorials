## Introduction
When working with HTML documents in Java, configuring fonts correctly is essential for creating visually appealing and readable content. Whether you're generating reports, creating web pages, or converting documents, ensuring that your fonts are properly configured can make a significant difference. This tutorial will walk you through the process of configuring fonts in Aspose.HTML for Java, from setting up your environment to converting HTML to PDF with custom fonts. So, let’s dive in!

## Prerequisites
Before we get started, there are a few prerequisites you'll need to have in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 1.8 or above installed on your system.
2. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: You can download the library from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to manage your project.
4. Basic Knowledge of Java Programming: Familiarity with Java will help you follow the tutorial more effectively.
5. Aspose.HTML License: While you can use Aspose.HTML without a license, a temporary license or full license will remove any evaluation limitations. Get your [temporary license here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

## Import Packages
To begin, you’ll need to import the necessary packages into your Java project. These packages provide the classes and methods required to configure fonts, handle HTML documents, and convert them to other formats.
```java
import java.io.IOException;
```
These imports bring in the core functionality of Aspose.HTML for Java, allowing you to interact with HTML content programmatically.
## Step 1: Create the HTML Content
First, we need to create some basic HTML content that we'll later style and convert to PDF. This content will be saved in an HTML file.
### 1.1 Writing the HTML Code
We’ll start by defining some HTML code with a header and a paragraph. This code will be saved in a file named `user-agent-fontsetting.html`.
```java
String code = "<h1>FontsSettings property</h1>\r\n" +
    "<p>The FontsSettings property is used for configuration of fonts handling.</p>\r\n";
```
This string contains the HTML content that we want to style. Notice that it includes a header (`<h1>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`).
### 1.2 Saving the HTML Content to a File
Next, you’ll save this HTML content to a file using a `FileWriter`.
```java
try (java.io.FileWriter fileWriter = new java.io.FileWriter("user-agent-fontsetting.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(code);
}
```
This code snippet writes the HTML string to a file named `user-agent-fontsetting.html` in your project directory.
## Step 2: Configure the Aspose.HTML Environment
With the HTML file ready, the next step is to configure the Aspose.HTML environment, which involves setting up font handling and other styling parameters.
### 2.1 Creating an Instance of Configuration
We begin by creating an instance of the `Configuration` class, which allows us to configure various aspects of how HTML documents are processed.
```java
com.aspose.html.Configuration configuration = new com.aspose.html.Configuration();
```
This instance will be used to access and modify the user agent settings, which control how the HTML is rendered.
### 2.2 Accessing the User Agent Service
The user agent service is responsible for applying styles and managing fonts. We'll retrieve this service from the configuration.
```java
com.aspose.html.services.IUserAgentService userAgent = configuration.getService(com.aspose.html.services.IUserAgentService.class);
```
This line of code fetches the `IUserAgentService`, which we will use to apply custom styles and configure font settings.
## Step 3: Apply Custom Styles and Fonts
Now that the environment is set up, let's apply some custom styles and specify the fonts we want to use.
### 3.1 Setting Custom Styles
We’ll define custom styles for the header (`h1`) and paragraph (`p`) elements in the HTML document. 
```java
userAgent.setUserStyleSheet("h1 { color:#a52a2a; }\r\n" +
    "p { color:grey; }\r\n");
```
Here, we’re applying a brown color (`#a52a2a`) to the header and a grey color (`grey`) to the paragraph text. These styles will be applied to the elements when the document is processed.
### 3.2 Setting the Custom Font Folder
To ensure that our document uses the correct fonts, we’ll set a custom folder where our fonts are stored.
```java
userAgent.getFontsSettings().setFontsLookupFolder("fonts");
```
This line tells Aspose.HTML to look for fonts in the `fonts` directory. Make sure that this folder contains the necessary font files (e.g., `.ttf` or `.otf` files).
## Step 4: Load the HTML Document with the Configuration
With everything configured, it's time to load the HTML document using our customized settings.

We'll initialize an `HTMLDocument` object with the specified configuration and the path to our HTML file.
```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument("user-agent-fontsetting.html", configuration);
```
This step creates an `HTMLDocument` object that is ready to be processed using the custom styles and fonts we’ve configured.
## Step 5: Convert HTML to PDF
The final step in this tutorial is to convert the styled HTML document into a PDF file.

We'll use the `Converter` class to convert our HTML document to PDF format.
```java
com.aspose.html.converters.Converter.convertHTML(
    document,
    new com.aspose.html.saving.PdfSaveOptions(),
    "user-agent-fontsetting_out.pdf"
);
```
This code snippet converts the HTML document into a PDF file named `user-agent-fontsetting_out.pdf`. The `PdfSaveOptions` parameter allows you to specify various settings for the PDF output.
## Step 6: Clean Up Resources
After the conversion is complete, it’s important to dispose of the objects to free up resources.
### 6.1 Disposing of the Document
Make sure to dispose of the `HTMLDocument` object to avoid memory leaks.
```java
if (document != null) {
    document.dispose();
}
```
This ensures that all resources associated with the `HTMLDocument` are released.
### 6.2 Disposing of the Configuration
Similarly, dispose of the `Configuration` object when you're done with it.
```java
if (configuration != null) {
    configuration.dispose();
}
```
This final cleanup step ensures that your application runs efficiently without consuming unnecessary resources.

## Conclusion
