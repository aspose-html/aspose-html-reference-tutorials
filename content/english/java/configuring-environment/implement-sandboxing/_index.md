## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to implement sandboxing using Aspose.HTML for Java. We'll take you from setting up your environment to writing a simple HTML file, configuring the sandbox, and converting your HTML to a PDF, all while keeping potentially harmful scripts under control. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will give you the tools you need to create secure web content with ease.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the code, let’s make sure you’ve got everything you need:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Aspose.HTML for Java: Download and set up Aspose.HTML for Java. You can get the latest version from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
3. IDE or Text Editor: Choose your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or a simple text editor.
4. Basic Understanding of HTML and Java: While we’ll guide you through each step, a foundational knowledge of HTML and Java will help you grasp the concepts more easily.
5. Aspose License: To use Aspose.HTML without any limitations, you'll need a valid license. You can obtain a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) or [purchase one](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

## Import Packages
Before writing any code, we need to import the necessary packages. Here's what you'll need to include:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
```
These imports bring in the core functionalities required for HTML document manipulation, sandboxing, and conversion to PDF.

## Step 1: Create Your HTML Content
The first thing we need is a simple HTML file that we’ll later sandbox. Here’s how to create it:
```java
String code = "<span>Hello World!!</span>\n" +
              "<script>document.write('Have a nice day!');</script>\n";
```
This HTML content is straightforward. We have a `<span>` element that says "Hello World!!" and a `<script>` tag that writes "Have a nice day!" onto the document. However, since scripts can be a security risk, we’ll sandbox it in the next steps.
```java
try (java.io.FileWriter fileWriter = new java.io.FileWriter("sandboxing.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(code);
}
```
Here, we’re writing our HTML content to a file named `sandboxing.html`. The `try-with-resources` statement ensures that the file writer is closed properly after the operation is complete.
## Step 2: Configure the Sandboxing Environment
Now, let's set up the sandboxing configuration to control the execution of scripts in our HTML document.
```java
com.aspose.html.Configuration configuration = new com.aspose.html.Configuration();
```
We start by creating an instance of `Configuration`. This object will allow us to set security restrictions, specifically around scripts.
```java
configuration.setSecurity(com.aspose.html.Sandbox.Scripts);
```
Here, we’re telling our configuration to treat scripts as an untrusted resource. This means any script in our HTML will not be executed, keeping our content secure.
## Step 3: Initialize the HTML Document with Sandbox Configuration
With our sandbox configuration ready, it’s time to create an HTML document that adheres to these security settings.
```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument("sandboxing.html", configuration);
```
This line initializes a new `HTMLDocument` with the specified sandbox configuration and the HTML file we created earlier. Now, our HTML document is wrapped in a protective layer that controls script execution.
## Step 4: Convert the Sandboxed HTML to PDF
The final step is converting our sandboxed HTML into a PDF document, which you can save or share.
```java
com.aspose.html.converters.Converter.convertHTML(
        document,
        new com.aspose.html.saving.PdfSaveOptions(),
        "sandboxing_out.pdf"
);
```
We use the `Converter.convertHTML` method to convert our HTML document to a PDF. The `PdfSaveOptions` class allows us to specify how we want the PDF to be saved. In this case, the PDF will be saved as `sandboxing_out.pdf`.
## Step 5: Clean Up Resources
Good practice in Java development is to release resources when they are no longer needed. Here’s how to do that:
```java
if (document != null) {
    document.dispose();
}
if (configuration != null) {
    configuration.dispose();
}
```
This ensures that the `HTMLDocument` and `Configuration` objects are properly disposed of, freeing up memory and other resources.

## Conclusion
And there you have it! You've successfully implemented sandboxing in Aspose.HTML for Java. By following this guide, you've learned how to create an HTML document, apply sandboxing to control script execution, and convert your secure HTML content into a PDF. This approach is essential for ensuring that your web content remains secure, especially when dealing with untrusted or dynamic content.
Sandboxing is a powerful tool in web development, giving you control over what gets executed in your HTML documents. With Aspose.HTML for Java, implementing this feature is straightforward and efficient. Whether you're securing a simple web page or working on a complex application, the principles covered in this tutorial will serve you well.
## FAQ's
### What is sandboxing in Aspose.HTML for Java?
Sandboxing in Aspose.HTML for Java is a security feature that allows you to control the execution of scripts and other potentially harmful content in your HTML documents.
### Can I customize the sandboxing settings?
Yes, you can customize the sandboxing settings by adjusting the security configurations in Aspose.HTML for Java.
### Is sandboxing necessary for all HTML documents?
Not always, but it's crucial when working with untrusted content or when you need to enforce strict security controls.
### How do I know if my scripts are blocked?
Scripts that are sandboxed will not execute, and their effects (like `document.write`) will not appear in the output.
### Can I convert sandboxed HTML to other formats besides PDF?
Absolutely! Aspose.HTML for Java supports conversion to various formats, including images, XPS, and more.
