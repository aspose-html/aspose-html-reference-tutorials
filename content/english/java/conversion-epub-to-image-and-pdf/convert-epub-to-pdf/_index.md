You should have the EPUB document that you want to convert to PDF. Make sure to provide the correct path to the EPUB file in your Java code.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, you must import the necessary Aspose.HTML for Java packages. Below is an example of how to import these packages:

```

## Step 2: Initialize pdfSaveOptions

Create an instance of PdfSaveOptions to configure the PDF conversion process. You can set options like JPEG quality if needed.

```java
PdfSaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions();
options.setJpegQuality(100);
```

## Step 3: Define Output File Path

Specify the path where you want to save the converted PDF file.

```java
String outputFile = "EPUBtoPDF_Output.pdf";
```

## Step 4: Convert EPUB to PDF

Now, it's time to initiate the conversion process by calling the `convertEPUB` method. Pass the fileInputStream, options, and the output file path as parameters.

```java
