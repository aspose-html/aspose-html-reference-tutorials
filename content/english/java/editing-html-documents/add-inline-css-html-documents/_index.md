## Introduction
If you're dealing with HTML documents and want to spice up the content with some inline CSS, you're in the right place! Aspose.HTML for Java offers a powerful way to manipulate HTML files, allowing you to add styles, create responsive designs, and much more. Whether you're a developer looking to automate document creation or simply interested in how to dynamically style HTML content using Java, this guide will walk you through the process step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, let's make sure you have everything you need:
1. Aspose.HTML for Java: You'll need to have Aspose.HTML for Java installed in your development environment. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from the [Aspose.HTML for Java Download page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
2. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or above installed. If not, you can download it from the Oracle website.
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use any IDE of your choice, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
4. Aspose.HTML License: While you can try Aspose.HTML for Java with a free trial, it's recommended to get a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) or purchase a full license for full functionality.

## Import Packages
To start using Aspose.HTML for Java, you'll need to import the necessary packages into your Java class. Here's how to set up your imports:
```java
import com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument;
import com.aspose.html.HTMLElement;
```
These imports bring in the classes required to create an HTML document, manipulate elements, and render the output as a PDF.
## Step 1: Create an HTML Document
The first step in adding inline CSS to an HTML document is to create the document itself. This document will be your canvas, and it can be as simple or as complex as you like. For this tutorial, we'll start with a basic paragraph element.
```java
String content = "<p>Inline CSS Example</p>";
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument(content, ".");
```
In this step, you're creating an `HTMLDocument` object from a string containing your HTML content. The second argument `"."` indicates the base URL, which in this case, is the current directory.
## Step 2: Locate the Paragraph Element
Now that your document is set up, the next step is to find the HTML element you want to style. In this case, we're focusing on the `<p>` element.
```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLElement paragraph = (com.aspose.html.HTMLElement) document.getElementsByTagName("p").get_Item(0);
```
Here, you're accessing the first `<p>` element in the document using `getElementsByTagName`. The method returns a list of elements, and `get_Item(0)` grabs the first one in the list.
## Step 3: Apply Inline CSS
With the paragraph element in hand, it's time to add some style. Inline CSS is perfect for small, specific tweaks directly within the HTML element.
```java
paragraph.setAttribute("style", "font-size: 250%; font-family: verdana; color: #cd66aa");
```
In this step, the `setAttribute` method is used to add a `style` attribute to the paragraph element. The CSS styles are written as a string, setting the font size, font family, and text color.
## Step 4: Save the HTML Document
After applying your styles, you'll likely want to save the modified HTML document. This can be done easily with the `save` method provided by Aspose.HTML for Java.
```java
document.save("edit-inline-css.html");
```
Here, you're saving the HTML document with the inline CSS to a file named `edit-inline-css.html` in the current directory. This allows you to view the styled HTML content in a browser.
## Step 5: Render the HTML Document as PDF
Finally, if you want to convert your styled HTML document into a PDF, Aspose.HTML for Java has got you covered. This is particularly useful if you need a print-ready version of your document.
```java
com.aspose.html.rendering.pdf.PdfDevice device = new com.aspose.html.rendering.pdf.PdfDevice("edit-inline-css.pdf");
document.renderTo(device);
```
In this final step, you create a `PdfDevice` instance, specifying the output file name as `edit-inline-css.pdf`. Then, you render the HTML document to this PDF device, effectively converting your HTML to a PDF file.
