## Prerequisites

Before diving into the conversion process, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:

1. Java Development Environment

You should have Java installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [Java's website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

2. Aspose.HTML for Java

You will need an EPUB file that you want to convert to an image. Ensure you have this file ready for the conversion.

4. Basic Java Knowledge

A fundamental understanding of Java is required for this tutorial.

## Import Packages

Now, let's get started with the process of converting an EPUB to an image using Aspose.HTML for Java. The first step is to import the necessary packages.

### Step 1: Import Aspose.HTML Packages

Begin by importing the Aspose.HTML packages you'll need for the conversion process:

## Breakdown

Next, let's break down the example code into multiple steps for a better understanding of the conversion process.

In this step, we open an existing EPUB file for reading. Replace `input.epub` with the path to your EPUB file.

```java
try (java.io.FileInputStream fileInputStream = new java.io.FileInputStream("input.epub")) {
```

### Step 3: Convert EPUB to Image

Here, we call the `convertEPUB` method to convert the EPUB file to an image. We specify the image format (JPEG) and the output path. You can customize the output format and path as needed.

```java
    Converter.convertEPUB(
        fileInputStream,
        new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Jpeg),
