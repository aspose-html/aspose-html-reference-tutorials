In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of adjusting the XPS page size using Aspose.HTML for Java. This powerful library allows you to manipulate HTML documents and render them into various formats, including XPS. Adjusting the page size is essential when you need to control the output dimensions of your XPS document.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

2. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: You need to download and include the Aspose.HTML for Java library in your Java project. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

3. Input HTML File: Prepare an HTML file that you want to render and adjust the XPS page size for. You can use your own HTML file for this tutorial.

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.HTML for Java. Include these packages at the beginning of your Java class:

```java
import com.aspose.html.drawing.Page;
import com.aspose.html.rendering.HtmlRenderer;
import com.aspose.html.rendering.PageSetup;
import com.aspose.html.rendering.xps.XpsDevice;
import com.aspose.html.rendering.xps.XpsRenderingOptions;
import com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument;
```

## Step 1: Set the Input File Name

```java
try (java.io.FileInputStream fileInputStream = new java.io.FileInputStream("YourInputFile.html")) {
    // ...
}
```

In this step, we read your HTML input file using a `FileInputStream`.

## Step 2: Create an HTML Document and Set Styles

```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument html_document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument("YourOutputFile.html");

String style = "<style>\n" +
               ".st\n" +
               "{\n" +
               "color: green;\n" +
               "}\n" +
               "</style>\n" +
               "<div id=id1>Aspose.HTML rendering Text in Black Color</div>\n" +
               "<div id=id2 class=''st''>Aspose.HTML rendering Text in Green Color</div>\n" +
               "<div id=id3 class=''st'' style='color: blue;'>Aspose.HTML rendering Text in Blue Color</div>\n" +
               "<div id=id3 class=''st'' style='color: red;'>Aspose.HTML rendering Text in Red Color</div>\n";

// ...
```

This step involves creating an `HTMLDocument` and adding styles to it.

## Step 3: Create XPS Rendering Options

```java
com.aspose.html.rendering.xps.XpsRenderingOptions xps_options = new com.aspose.html.rendering.xps.XpsRenderingOptions();
```

Here, we create XPS rendering options to configure the rendering process.

## Step 4: Adjust the Page Size

```java
com.aspose.html.drawing.Page page = new com.aspose.html.drawing.Page(new com.aspose.html.drawing.Size(100, 100));
com.aspose.html.rendering.PageSetup pageSetup = new com.aspose.html.rendering.PageSetup();
pageSetup.setAnyPage(page);
pageSetup.setAdjustToWidestPage(false);
xps_options.setPageSetup(pageSetup);
```

This step involves setting the page size and specifying whether to adjust it to the widest page.

## Step 5: Render the Output

```java
com.aspose.html.rendering.xps.XpsDevice device = new com.aspose.html.rendering.xps.XpsDevice(xps_options, "YourOutputFile.xps");

renderer.render(device, html_document);
```

In the final step, we render the XPS output using the configured options.
