## Introduction
Are you ready to take your CSS skills to the next level? Imagine effortlessly applying advanced styling to your HTML documents, customizing margins, and inserting content in those margins like a pro—all while using Java! Sounds exciting, right? This is exactly what we'll explore in this tutorial. We'll dive into the world of Aspose.HTML for Java and discover how to leverage its powerful capabilities to enhance your CSS styling. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will walk you through every step with clear explanations and hands-on examples.
In this tutorial, we'll focus on applying custom margins and adding content to those margins using Aspose.HTML for Java. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to control page layout with CSS and how to generate documents with dynamic content, such as page numbers and titles, in your desired style.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure you have the following in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 1.8 or above installed on your system. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: Download and integrate the latest version of Aspose.HTML for Java. You can get it from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
3. IDE Setup: Set up your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to write and execute Java code.
4. Basic Knowledge of HTML and CSS: A fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS will be beneficial as we dive into the code examples.
5. Familiarity with Java Programming: You should be comfortable with basic Java syntax and concepts.
## Import Packages
Before you start writing the code, you need to import the necessary packages that will allow you to work with Aspose.HTML for Java. These packages include classes for configuration, document handling, and rendering.
```java
import com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument;
```
## Step 1: Setting Up the Configuration
The first step in our journey is to set up the configuration for Aspose.HTML. This configuration will allow us to customize various aspects of how our HTML document is processed and rendered.
```java
// Initialize the configuration object
com.aspose.html.Configuration configuration = new com.aspose.html.Configuration();
```
In this step, we create a new instance of the `Configuration` class. This object will be used to manage the settings for our HTML processing tasks.
## Step 2: Accessing the User Agent Service
The User Agent Service in Aspose.HTML is a powerful feature that allows you to manage how your HTML content is interpreted and styled. We will use it to apply custom CSS rules to our document.
```java
// Get the User Agent service from the configuration
com.aspose.html.services.IUserAgentService userAgent = configuration.getService(com.aspose.html.services.IUserAgentService.class);
```
Here, we retrieve the User Agent service from the configuration. This service will enable us to inject custom CSS styles directly into the document processing pipeline.
## Step 3: Defining Custom CSS for Page Margins
Now that we have access to the User Agent Service, it’s time to define some custom CSS. This CSS will control the page margins and add dynamic content like page numbers and titles.
```java
// Define custom CSS to control page layout
userAgent.setUserStyleSheet(
        "@page {\n" +
        "  margin-top: 1cm;\n" +
        "  margin-left: 2cm;\n" +
        "  margin-right: 2cm;\n" +
        "  margin-bottom: 2cm;\n" +
        "  @bottom-right {\n" +
        "    -aspose-content: \"Page \" currentPageNumber() \" of \" totalPagesNumber();\n" +
        "    color: green;\n" +
        "  }\n" +
        "  @top-center {\n" +
        "    -aspose-content: \"Hello World Document Title!!!\";\n" +
        "    vertical-align: bottom;\n" +
        "    color: blue;\n" +
        "  }\n" +
        "}"
);
```
In this step, we define a CSS rule using the `setUserStyleSheet` method. The `@page` rule specifies custom margins for the page, and the `@bottom-right` and `@top-center` rules add dynamic content (like page numbers and titles) to the bottom-right and top-center of the page, respectively.
## Step 4: Initializing the HTML Document
With our CSS defined, the next step is to create an HTML document. This document will be processed using the configuration and styling we’ve set up.
```java
// Initialize an HTML document with custom content
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument("<div>Hello World!!!</div>", ".", configuration);
```
Here, we create a new `HTMLDocument` object, passing in a simple HTML string (`<div>Hello World!!!</div>`) and the configuration object we set up earlier. This document will be styled according to the CSS rules we’ve defined.
## Step 5: Setting Up the Output Device
To render the document, we need to specify an output device. In this tutorial, we’ll render the document to an XPS file, which is a fixed-layout document format.
```java
// Initialize an XPS device for rendering output
com.aspose.html.rendering.xps.XpsDevice device = new com.aspose.html.rendering.xps.XpsDevice("output/output.xps");
```
In this step, we create an `XpsDevice` object that specifies the output path for the rendered document. This is where the final output will be saved.
## Step 6: Rendering the Document
The final step is to send the HTML document to the output device. This will apply the custom styles and save the document in the specified format.
```java
// Render the HTML document to the XPS device
document.renderTo(device);
```
Here, we use the `renderTo` method to process the HTML document and render it to the XPS device. This step applies all the styling and outputs the document as a fixed-layout file.
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You’ve just completed a comprehensive guide on applying advanced CSS extension techniques using Aspose.HTML for Java. By following the steps in this tutorial, you’ve learned how to set up configurations, access the User Agent service, define custom CSS for page margins, and render an HTML document to an XPS file. These skills are incredibly powerful, allowing you to customize your document’s layout and style in ways that were previously challenging or impossible. 
Now that you’ve mastered these techniques, you can start experimenting with more complex layouts, dynamic content, and even different output formats. The possibilities are endless with Aspose.HTML for Java, and I encourage you to explore and push the boundaries of what you can achieve.
