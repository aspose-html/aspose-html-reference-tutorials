### HTML Document to Work With

Prepare an HTML document that you want to convert to another format. Ensure you have this document available in your working directory.

## Import Namespace

Now that you've set up the prerequisites let's start by importing the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.HTML for .NET.

### Import the Aspose.HTML Namespace

To use Aspose.HTML, you need to include the relevant namespace in your C# code:

## Converting HTML to BMP

In this tutorial, we'll focus on converting an HTML document to a BMP image format using Aspose.HTML for .NET.

### Define the Data Directory

Start by specifying the path to your data directory. This is where your HTML document is located. Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```

### Load the HTML Document

To work with your HTML document, you need to load it into an `HTMLDocument` object. Replace `"input.html"` with the name of your HTML document.

```csharp
HTMLDocument htmlDocument = new HTMLDocument(dataDir + "input.html");
```

### Initialize ImageSaveOptions

Before performing the conversion, initialize `ImageSaveOptions`. In this case, we are converting to BMP format.

```csharp
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Bmp);
```

### Specify the Output File Path

You need to provide the path where the converted BMP file will be saved. Replace `"HTMLtoBMP_Output.bmp"` with your desired output file path.

```csharp
string outputFile = dataDir + "HTMLtoBMP_Output.bmp";
```

### Convert HTML to BMP

Now, it's time to perform the conversion. Use the `Converter` class to convert the HTML document to BMP format.

```csharp
Converter.ConvertHTML(htmlDocument, options, outputFile);
```

Congratulations! You have successfully converted an HTML document to a BMP image using Aspose.HTML for .NET.
