Are you looking for a seamless way to convert EPUB files to XPS format in your .NET applications? Aspose.HTML for .NET provides a powerful solution to achieve this effortlessly. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of converting EPUB to XPS using Aspose.HTML. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into the EPUB to XPS conversion process, you'll need to ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. Aspose.HTML for .NET Library

Make sure you have Aspose.HTML for .NET library installed in your project. If you haven't done so, you can obtain it from the [Aspose.HTML for .NET Download page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/).

### 2. Input EPUB File

You'll need an EPUB file that you want to convert to XPS. Ensure that you have an EPUB file available for conversion.

### 3. .NET Development Environment

This guide assumes you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine.

## Import Namespace

To begin, you should import the necessary namespace for Aspose.HTML:

```csharp
using Aspose.Html.Saving;
using Aspose.Html.Converters;
using Aspose.Html.Drawing;
```

## Convert EPUB to XPS

Let's break down the process of converting an EPUB file to XPS format into multiple steps.

### Step 1.1: Open the EPUB File

First, open the existing EPUB file for reading using a FileStream:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
using (var stream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(dataDir + "input.epub"))
{
    // Continue with the conversion process
}
```

### Step 1.2: Create XpsSaveOptions

Create an instance of XpsSaveOptions. This step is crucial for configuring the XPS output:

```csharp
var options = new XpsSaveOptions();
```

### Step 1.3: Convert EPUB to XPS

Now, let's call the ConvertEPUB method to convert the EPUB to XPS:

```csharp
ConvertEPUB(stream, options, "output.xps");
```

## Specify Custom XPS Options

You can further customize the XPS output by specifying custom options such as page size and background color.

### Step 2.1: Custom Page Size and Background Color

Create an instance of XpsSaveOptions with custom page size and background color:

```csharp
var options = new XpsSaveOptions()
{
    PageSetup =
    {
        AnyPage = new Page()
        {
            Size = new Size(Length.FromPixels(3000), Length.FromPixels(1000))
        }
    },
    BackgroundColor = System.Drawing.Color.AliceBlue,
};
```

### Step 2.2: Convert EPUB to XPS with Custom Options

Now, call the ConvertEPUB method to convert the EPUB to XPS with the custom options:

```csharp
ConvertEPUB(stream, options, "output.xps");
```

## Use Custom Stream Provider

In this step, we will convert EPUB to XPS using a custom stream provider, allowing you to manipulate the resulting data.

### Step 3.1: Create a MemoryStreamProvider

Create an instance of MemoryStreamProvider:

```csharp
using (var streamProvider = new MemoryStreamProvider())
{
    // Continue with the conversion process
}
```

### Step 3.2: Convert EPUB to XPS with Stream Provider

Convert EPUB to XPS by using the MemoryStreamProvider:

```csharp
ConvertEPUB(stream, new XpsSaveOptions(), streamProvider);
```

### Step 3.3: Access and Save Result

Retrieve the memory stream containing the converted data and save it to an output file:

```csharp
var memory = streamProvider.Streams.First();
memory.Seek(0, System.IO.SeekOrigin.Begin);

using (System.IO.FileStream fs = System.IO.File.Create("output.xps"))
{
    memory.CopyTo(fs);
}
```

### Class MemoryStreamProvider Source Code

```csharp
class MemoryStreamProvider : Aspose.Html.IO.ICreateStreamProvider
        {
            // List of MemoryStream objects created during the document rendering
            public List<System.IO.MemoryStream> Streams { get; } = new List<System.IO.MemoryStream>();
            public System.IO.Stream GetStream(string name, string extension)
            {
                // This method is called when the only one output stream is required, for instance for XPS, PDF or TIFF formats.
                System.IO.MemoryStream result = new System.IO.MemoryStream();
                Streams.Add(result);
                return result;
            }
            public System.IO.Stream GetStream(string name, string extension, int page)
            {
                // This method is called when the creation of multiple output streams are required. For instance during the rendering HTML to list of the image files (JPG, PNG, etc.)
                System.IO.MemoryStream result = new System.IO.MemoryStream();
                Streams.Add(result);
                return result;
            }
            public void ReleaseStream(System.IO.Stream stream)
            {
                //  Here You can release the stream filled with data and, for instance, flush it to the hard-drive
            }
            public void Dispose()
            {
                // Releasing resources
                foreach (var stream in Streams)
                    stream.Dispose();
            }
        }
```
Congratulations! You've successfully converted an EPUB file to XPS format using Aspose.HTML for .NET.
