### Step 3: Define Request URI

```csharp
string requestUri = "https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd";
```

In this step, you define the URI to which you want to make an HTTP request. This URI can be any web page you want to analyze or optimize for SEO.

### Step 4: Make an HTTP Request

```csharp
try
{
    var response = document.Context.Network.Send(new RequestMessage(requestUri)
    {
        Method = HttpMethod.Get,
        Credentials = new NetworkCredential("user", "passwd"),
        PreAuthenticate = true
    });
}
catch (System.Exception ex)

```

This is where you make an HTTP request to the specified URI. Aspose.HTML's Network feature allows you to send HTTP requests and retrieve responses from web pages.

### Step 5: Analyze the Response

```csharp
using (StringReader sr = new StringReader(response.Content.ReadAsString()))
{

    System.Console.WriteLine(sr.ReadToEnd());
}
```

In this final step, you analyze the response received from the web page. You can access the content type and read the content for further analysis or optimization.
