```

With the namespace imported, you're now ready to start using Aspose.HTML in your .NET project.

## Breakdown

To illustrate the power and versatility of Aspose.HTML for .NET, let's break down a common use case into multiple steps. In this example, we'll load HTML content from a URL and print its inner HTML to the console.

### Step 1: Load HTML Content from a URL

```csharp
// ExStart:LoadHtmlUsingURL
string inputHtml = "http://aspose.com/";

// Load HTML file using Url instance
HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument(new Url(inputHtml));
// ExEnd:LoadHtmlUsingURL
```

Here, we begin by specifying the URL of the HTML content we want to load. In this case, we use "http://aspose.com/." This example demonstrates how easy it is to fetch remote HTML content.

### Step 2: Print Inner HTML to Console

```csharp
// Print inner HTML of file to console
Console.WriteLine(document.Body.InnerHTML);
```

In this step, we print the inner HTML of the loaded document's `<body>` to the console. This allows you to inspect the retrieved HTML content.

By following these two simple steps, you've successfully loaded HTML content from a URL and displayed its inner HTML. This is just a glimpse of what Aspose.HTML for .NET can do for you.
