var paragraph = (Aspose.Html.HTMLElement)document.GetElementsByTagName("p").First();
var view = (Aspose.Html.Dom.Css.IViewCSS)document.Context.Window;
var declaration = view.GetComputedStyle(paragraph);
Console.WriteLine(declaration.Color); // Output: rgb(255, 0, 0)
```

### Step 3: Modify CSS Styles
