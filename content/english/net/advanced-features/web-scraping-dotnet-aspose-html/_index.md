In today's digital age, manipulating and extracting information from HTML documents is a common task for developers. Aspose.HTML for .NET is a powerful tool that simplifies HTML processing and manipulation in .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore various aspects of Aspose.HTML for .NET, including prerequisites, namespaces, and step-by-step examples to help you harness its full potential.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the world of Aspose.HTML for .NET, you'll need a few prerequisites:

1. Development Environment: Ensure you have a working development environment set up with Visual Studio or any other compatible IDE for .NET development.

2. Aspose.HTML for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.HTML for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/). You can choose between the free trial version or a licensed one based on your needs.

3. Basic Knowledge of HTML: Familiarity with HTML structure and elements is essential to effectively use Aspose.HTML for .NET.

## Importing Namespaces

To begin, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# project. These namespaces provide access to the Aspose.HTML for .NET classes and functionalities:

```csharp
using Aspose.Html;
using Aspose.Html.Dom;
using Aspose.Html.XPath;
using Aspose.Html.Css;
```

With the prerequisites in place and namespaces imported, let's break down some key examples step by step to illustrate how to use Aspose.HTML for .NET effectively.

## Navigating Through HTML

In this example, we'll navigate through an HTML document and access its elements step by step.

```csharp
public static void NavigateThroughHTML()
{
    // Prepare an HTML code
    var html_code = "<span>Hello</span> <span>World!</span>";
    
    // Initialize a document from the prepared code
    using (var document = new HTMLDocument(html_code, "."))
    {
        // Get the reference to the first child (first SPAN) of the BODY
        var element = document.Body.FirstChild;
        Console.WriteLine(element.TextContent); // Output: Hello

        // Get the reference to the whitespace between HTML elements
        element = element.NextSibling;
        Console.WriteLine(element.TextContent); // Output: ' '

        // Get the reference to the second SPAN element
        element = element.NextSibling;
        Console.WriteLine(element.TextContent); // Output: World!
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an HTML document, access its first child (a `SPAN` element), the whitespace between elements, and the second `SPAN` element, demonstrating basic navigation.

## Using Node Filters

Node filters allow you to selectively process specific elements within an HTML document.

```csharp
public static void NodeFilterUsageExample()
{
    // Prepare an HTML code
    var code = @"
        <p>Hello</p>
        <img src='image1.png'>
        <img src='image2.png'>
        <p>World!</p>";
    
    // Initialize a document based on the prepared code
    using (var document = new HTMLDocument(code, "."))
    {
        // Create a TreeWalker with a custom filter for image elements
        using (var iterator = document.CreateTreeWalker(document, NodeFilter.SHOW_ALL, new OnlyImageFilter()))
        {
            while (iterator.NextNode() != null)
            {
                var image = (HTMLImageElement)iterator.CurrentNode;
                Console.WriteLine(image.Src);
                // Output: image1.png
                // Output: image2.png
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to use a custom node filter to extract specific elements (in this case, `IMG` elements) from the HTML document.

## XPath Queries

XPath queries enable you to search for elements in an HTML document based on specific criteria.

```csharp
public static void XPathQueryUsageExample()
{
    // Prepare an HTML code
    var code = @"
        <div class='happy'>
            <div>
                <span>Hello!</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class='happy'>
            <span>World</span>
        </p>
    ";
    
    // Initialize a document based on the prepared code
    using (var document = new HTMLDocument(code, "."))
    {
        // Evaluate an XPath expression to select specific elements
        var result = document.Evaluate("//*[@class='happy']//span",
                                        document,
                                        null,
                                        XPathResultType.Any,
                                        null);
        
        // Iterate over the resulted nodes
        for (Node node; (node = result.IterateNext()) != null;)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(node.TextContent);
            // Output: Hello
            // Output: World!
        }
    }
}
```

This example showcases the use of XPath queries to locate elements in the HTML document based on their attributes and structure.

## CSS Selectors

CSS selectors provide an alternative way to select elements in an HTML document, similar to how CSS stylesheets target elements.

```csharp
public static void CSSSelectorUsageExample()
{
    // Prepare an HTML code
    var code = @"
        <div class='happy'>
            <div>
                <span>Hello</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class='happy'>
            <span>World!</span>
        </p>
    ";
    
    // Initialize a document based on the prepared code
    using (var document = new HTMLDocument(code, "."))
    {
        // Use a CSS selector to extract elements based on class and hierarchy
        var elements = document.QuerySelectorAll(".happy span");
        
        // Iterate over the resulted list of elements
        foreach (HTMLElement element in elements)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(element.InnerHTML);
            // Output: Hello
            // Output: World!
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we demonstrate how to use CSS selectors to target specific elements in the HTML document.
