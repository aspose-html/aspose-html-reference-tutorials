If you're looking to work with HTML documents and templates in your .NET applications, you're in the right place! Aspose.HTML for .NET is a versatile library that empowers developers to manipulate HTML documents and templates effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the essentials of using Aspose.HTML for .NET, breaking down each step and providing a clear explanation along the way.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of Aspose.HTML for .NET, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. You can download it from the website if you don't already have it.

2. Aspose.HTML for .NET: You need to have Aspose.HTML for .NET installed in your Visual Studio project. You can obtain it from the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/).

3. JSON Data: Prepare a JSON data source that you want to use for populating your HTML template. For this tutorial, we'll use the following JSON data:

```json
{
    'FirstName': 'John',
    'LastName': 'Smith',
    'Address': {
        'City': 'Dallas',
        'Street': 'Austin rd.',
        'Number': '200'
    }
}
```

4. HTML Template: Create an HTML template that you want to fill with the JSON data. Here's a simple example:

```html
<table border=1>
    <tr>
        <th>Person</th>
        <th>Address</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>{{FirstName}} {{LastName}}</td>
        <td>{{Address.Street}} {{Address.Number}}, {{Address.City}}</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

## Importing Namespaces

First things first, let's import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Html.Converters;
using Aspose.Html.Loading;
```

Now that we've covered the prerequisites and imported the required namespaces, let's break down each step in detail.

## Step 1: Prepare a JSON Data Source

Begin by creating a JSON data source that holds the information you want to insert into your HTML template. In this example, we have already prepared a JSON data source as mentioned in the prerequisites. Save it to a file, for instance, "data-source.json."

```csharp
var data = @"{
    'FirstName': 'John',
    'LastName': 'Smith',
    'Address': {
        'City': 'Dallas',
        'Street': 'Austin rd.',
        'Number': '200'
    }
}";
System.IO.File.WriteAllText("data-source.json", data);
```

This code snippet reads the JSON data and writes it to a file named "data-source.json."

## Step 2: Prepare an HTML Template

Now, let's create an HTML template that you want to populate with the JSON data. Save this template to a file, such as "template.html."

```csharp
var template = @"
<table border=1>
    <tr>
        <th>Person</th>
        <th>Address</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>{{FirstName}} {{LastName}}</td>
        <td>{{Address.Street}} {{Address.Number}}, {{Address.City}}</td>
    </tr>
</table>
";
System.IO.File.WriteAllText("template.html", template);
```

This HTML template includes placeholders like `{{FirstName}}`, `{{LastName}}`, `{{Address.Street}}`, `{{Address.Number}}`, and `{{Address.City}}`, which we'll replace with the actual data.

## Step 3: Populate the HTML Template

Finally, invoke the `Converter.ConvertTemplate` method to populate your HTML template with the data from the JSON source.

```csharp
Aspose.Html.Converters.Converter.ConvertTemplate(
"template.html", new Aspose.Html.Converters.TemplateData("data-source.json"), new Aspose.Html.Loading.TemplateLoadOptions(), "document.html"
);
```

This code takes the "template.html" file, substitutes the placeholders with the corresponding JSON values, and saves the result in "document.html."

Congratulations! You've successfully harnessed the power of Aspose.HTML for .NET to dynamically generate HTML documents from JSON data.
