Welcome to our tutorial on using Aspose.HTML for .NET, a powerful tool for handling HTML documents in your .NET applications. In this tutorial, we will take you through the essential steps to work with HTML documents using Aspose.HTML. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with .NET development, this guide will help you harness the full potential of Aspose.HTML for your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code examples, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: You'll need Visual Studio installed on your machine to follow along with the examples.

2. Aspose.HTML for .NET: You should have Aspose.HTML for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/).

3. A Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will be helpful, but even if you're new to C#, you can still follow along and learn.

## Importing Necessary Namespaces

To start using Aspose.HTML for .NET, you need to import the required namespaces. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using Aspose.Html;
using Aspose.Html.Dom;
using Aspose.Html.Dom.Css;
```

Now that you have the prerequisites covered let's break down each example into multiple steps and explain each step in detail.

## Example 1: Creating and Editing an HTML Document

```csharp
static void EditDocumentTree()
{
    using (var document = new Aspose.Html.HTMLDocument())
    {
        var body = document.Body;
        // Create paragraph element
        var p = (Aspose.Html.HTMLParagraphElement)document.CreateElement("p");
        // Set custom attribute
        p.SetAttribute("id", "my-paragraph");
        // Create text node
        var text = document.CreateTextNode("my first paragraph");
        // Attach text to the paragraph
        p.AppendChild(text);
        // Attach paragraph to the document body
        body.AppendChild(p);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. We start by creating a new HTML document using `Aspose.Html.HTMLDocument()`.

2. We access the document's body element.

3. Next, we create an HTML paragraph element (`<p>`) using `document.CreateElement("p")`.

4. We set a custom attribute `id` for the paragraph element.

5. A text node is created using `document.CreateTextNode("my first paragraph")`.

6. We attach the text node to the paragraph element using `p.AppendChild(text)`.

7. Finally, we attach the paragraph to the document's body.

This example demonstrates how to create and manipulate the structure of an HTML document.

## Example 2: Removing an Element from an HTML Document

```csharp
static void EditDocumentTreeWithAppendRemoveChild()
{
    using (var document = new Aspose.Html.HTMLDocument("<p>paragraph</p><div>some element to remove</div>", "about:blank"))
    {
        var body = document.Body;
        // Get "div" element
        var div = (Aspose.Html.HTMLDivElement)body.GetElementsByTagName("div").First();
        // Remove found element
        body.RemoveChild(div);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. We create an HTML document with existing elements, including a `<p>` and a `<div>`.

2. We access the document's body element.

3. Using `body.GetElementsByTagName("div").First()`, we retrieve the first `<div>` element in the document.

4. We remove the selected `<div>` element from the document's body using `body.RemoveChild(div)`.

This example demonstrates how to manipulate and remove elements from an existing HTML document.

## Example 3: Editing HTML Content

```csharp
static void EditHtml()
{
    using (var document = new Aspose.Html.HTMLDocument())
    {
        // Get body element
        var body = document.Body;
        // Set content of the body element
        body.InnerHTML = "<p>paragraph</p>";
        // Move to the first child
        var node = body.FirstChild;
        System.Console.WriteLine(node.LocalName);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. We create a new HTML document.

2. We access the document's body element.

3. Using `body.InnerHTML`, we set the HTML content of the body to `<p>paragraph</p>`.

4. We retrieve the first child element of the body using `body.FirstChild`.

5. We print the local name of the first child element to the console.

This example demonstrates how to set and retrieve the HTML content of an element within an HTML document.

## Example 4: Editing Element Styles

```csharp
static void EditElementStyle()
{
    using (var document = new Aspose.Html.HTMLDocument("<style>p { color: red; }</style><p>my first paragraph</p>", "about:blank"))
    {
        // Get the element to inspect
        var element = document.GetElementsByTagName("p")[0];
        // Get the CSS view object
        var view = (Aspose.Html.Dom.Css.IViewCSS)document.Context.Window;
        // Get the computed style of the element
        var declaration = view.GetComputedStyle(element);
        // Get "color" property value
        System.Console.WriteLine(declaration.Color); // rgb(255, 0, 0)
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. We create an HTML document with embedded CSS that sets the color of `<p>` elements to red.

2. We retrieve the `<p>` element using `document.GetElementsByTagName("p")[0]`.

3. We access the CSS view object and get the computed style of the `<p>` element.

4. We retrieve and print the value of the "color" property, which is set to red in the CSS.

This example demonstrates how to inspect and manipulate the CSS styles of HTML elements.

## Example 5: Changing Element Style Using Attributes

```csharp
static void EditElementStyleUsingAttribute()
{
    using (var document = new Aspose.Html.HTMLDocument("<style>p { color: red; }</style><p>my first paragraph</p>", "about:blank"))
    {
        // Get the element to edit
        var element = (Aspose.Html.HTMLElement)document.GetElementsByTagName("p")[0];
        // Get the CSS view object
        var view = (Aspose.Html.Dom.Css.IViewCSS)document.Context.Window;
        // Get the computed style of the element
        var declaration = view.GetComputedStyle(element);
        // Set green color
        element.Style.Color = "green";
        // Get "color" property value
        System.Console.WriteLine(declaration.Color); // rgb(0, 128, 0)
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. We create an HTML document with embedded CSS that sets the color of `<p>` elements to red.

2. We retrieve the `<p>` element using `document.GetElementsByTagName("p")[0]`.

3. We access the CSS view object and get the computed style of the `<p>` element before any changes.

4. We change the color of the `<p>` element to green using `element.Style.Color = "green"`.

5. We retrieve and print the updated value of the "color"

 property, which is now green.

This example demonstrates how to directly modify the style of an HTML element using attributes.
