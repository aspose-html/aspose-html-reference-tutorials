## Introduction

In the world of web development, creating and manipulating HTML documents is a fundamental task. Whether you're building a simple webpage or a complex web application, having a reliable tool for HTML document manipulation is crucial. In this tutorial, we will dive into the world of Aspose.HTML for .NET, a powerful library that allows you to work with HTML documents seamlessly. 

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, let's ensure you have the necessary prerequisites in place:

### 1. .NET Development Environment

You should have a .NET development environment set up on your machine. If you haven't already, you can download and install the latest version of .NET from the official Microsoft website.

### 2. Aspose.HTML for .NET

To follow along with the examples in this tutorial, you will need to download and install the Aspose.HTML for .NET library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/).

### 3. Text Editor or IDE

You'll need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run your .NET code. Popular choices include Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider.

Now that you have the prerequisites covered, let's proceed with the tutorial.

## Import Namespaces

Before we delve into the code examples, let's import the necessary namespaces from Aspose.HTML for .NET. These namespaces contain classes and methods that we will use to work with HTML documents.

```csharp
using Aspose.Html;
using Aspose.Html.Dom;
using Aspose.Html.Dom.HtmlBody;
using Aspose.Html.Rendering;
```

## Creating a Simple HTML Document

In this example, we will create a simple HTML document with an image, an ordered list, and a table. Let's break down each step and explain it in detail.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Output File

We start by defining the output file where our HTML document will be saved.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
String outputHtml = dataDir + "SimpleDocument.html";
```

### Step 2: Creating an HTML Document

Next, we create an instance of the `HTMLDocument` class, which represents an HTML document.

```csharp
var document = new HTMLDocument();
```

### Step 3: Adding an Image

Now, we add an image to the HTML document. We create an `img` element using the `CreateElement` method, set its `Src`, `Alt`, and `Title` attributes, and then append it to the document's `Body`.

```csharp
if (document.CreateElement("img") is HTMLImageElement img)
{
    img.Src = "http://via.placeholder.com/400x200";
    img.Alt = "Placeholder 400x200";
    img.Title = "Placeholder image";
    document.Body.AppendChild(img);
}
```

### Step 4: Adding an Ordered List

Next, we add an ordered list to the document. We create an `ol` element and iterate to add list items to it.

```csharp
var orderedListElement = document.CreateElement("ol") as HTMLOListElement;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    var listItem = document.CreateElement("li") as HTMLLIElement;
    listItem.TextContent = $" List Item {i + 1}";
    orderedListElement.AppendChild(listItem);
}
document.Body.AppendChild(orderedListElement);
```

### Step 5: Adding a Table

Finally, we add a table to the document. We create a `table` element, create rows and cells, set their `Id` and `TextContent`, and append them to the table.

```csharp
var table = document.CreateElement("table") as HTMLTableElement;
var tBody = document.CreateElement("tbody") as HTMLTableSectionElement;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    var row = document.CreateElement("tr") as HTMLTableRowElement;
    row.Id = "trow_" + i;
    for (var j = 0; j < 3; j++)
    {
        var cell = document.CreateElement("td") as HTMLTableCellElement;
        cell.Id = $"cell{i}_{j}";
        cell.TextContent = "Cell " + j;
        row.AppendChild(cell);
    }
    tBody.AppendChild(row);
}
table.AppendChild(tBody);
document.Body.AppendChild(table);
```

### Step 6: Saving the Document

Finally, we save the HTML document to the specified output file.

```csharp
document.Save(outputHtml);
```

Congratulations! You've just created a simple HTML document using Aspose.HTML for .NET. This is just the beginning of what you can achieve with this powerful library.
