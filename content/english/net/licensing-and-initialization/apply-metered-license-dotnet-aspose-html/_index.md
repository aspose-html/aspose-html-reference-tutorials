In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of applying a metered license in your .NET application using Aspose.HTML. A metered license is a convenient way to manage licensing for your HTML manipulation needs. By following the steps below, you'll be able to apply a metered license to your Aspose.HTML for .NET project.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A valid Aspose.HTML for .NET license. You can obtain it from [Aspose Purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).
- The Aspose.HTML for .NET library, which you can download from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/).
- Your data directory path where you have stored your input HTML file.

Now, let's break down the example code and explain each step in detail:

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, you need to include the necessary namespaces. Add the following using statements at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Html;
```

## Step by Step Guide

Here, we'll break down the example code into multiple steps and explain each step in detail.

### Set Data Directory Path:

   First, you should set the path to your data directory where your input HTML file is located. You will need to replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual path.

   ```csharp
   string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
   ```

### Set Metered Public and Private Keys:

   To apply a metered license, you need to provide your public and private keys. You can obtain these keys when you purchase a metered license from Aspose. Replace `"*****"` with your actual public and private keys.

   ```csharp
   Aspose.Html.Metered metered = new Aspose.Html.Metered();
   metered.SetMeteredKey("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY");
   ```

### Load the HTML Document:

   Load the HTML document from your data directory using the HTMLDocument class. Make sure to replace `"input.html"` with the actual filename.

   ```csharp
   HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument(dataDir + "input.html");
   ```

### Print the Inner HTML:

   After loading the HTML document, you can access and print the inner HTML of the file to the console for verification.

   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine(document.Body.InnerHTML);
   ```

That's it! You've successfully applied a metered license to your .NET project and loaded an HTML document.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've demonstrated how to apply a metered license using Aspose.HTML for .NET. By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate Aspose.HTML into your .NET applications for HTML manipulation.
