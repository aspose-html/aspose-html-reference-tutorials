In the ever-evolving landscape of web development and content generation, the need for efficient tools is paramount. Aspose.HTML for .NET is one such tool that allows developers to work with HTML and SVG documents seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of using Aspose.HTML for .NET to convert SVG to XPS, demonstrating the ease and power of this library.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: You'll need Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment installed on your system.

2. Aspose.HTML for .NET: Download the Aspose.HTML for .NET library from the website. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/).

3. Input SVG Document: Prepare an SVG document that you want to convert to XPS. Make sure you have this file saved in your data directory.

Now, let's get started with the tutorial.

## Import Namespaces

In this section, we'll import the necessary namespaces and break down each example into multiple steps, explaining each step in detail.

## Step 1: Initialize the Data Directory

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
```

In this step, we initialize the `dataDir` variable with the path to your data directory. You should replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual path where your input SVG document is located.

## Step 2: Load the SVG Document

```csharp
SVGDocument svgDocument = new SVGDocument(dataDir + "input.svg");
```

Here, we create an instance of `SVGDocument` and load the SVG document from the specified file path.

## Step 3: Initialize XpsSaveOptions

```csharp
XpsSaveOptions options = new XpsSaveOptions()
{
    BackgroundColor = System.Drawing.Color.Cyan
};
```

In this step, we initialize the `XpsSaveOptions` and set the background color to cyan. You can customize this option as per your requirements.

## Step 4: Define the Output File Path

```csharp
string outputFile = dataDir + "SVGtoXPS_Output.xps";
```

We specify the path for the output XPS file, which will be generated after the conversion.

## Step 5: Convert SVG to XPS

```csharp
Converter.ConvertSVG(svgDocument, options, outputFile);
```

Finally, we use the `Converter` class to convert the SVG document to XPS using the provided options. The resulting XPS file will be saved at the specified output file path.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly convert SVG to XPS using Aspose.HTML for .NET.

## Conclusion

Aspose.HTML for .NET is a powerful library that simplifies working with HTML and SVG documents. In this tutorial, we walked you through the process of converting SVG to XPS. By importing the necessary namespaces and following the steps, you can leverage this library to enhance your web development projects.

Now, you have the tools and knowledge to work with Aspose.HTML for .NET efficiently. So, start exploring its capabilities and unlock new possibilities in web development!
