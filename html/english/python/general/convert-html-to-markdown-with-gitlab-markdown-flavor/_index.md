# Convert HTML to Markdown with GitLab markdown flavor

If you need to **convert HTML to Markdown**, this guide shows you a complete solution that activates the **GitLab markdown flavor**. You’ll learn how to enable GitLab‑specific markdown features and transform an HTML file into a clean `README.md` ready for GitLab repositories.

The tutorial covers everything you need: installing the required library, configuring GitLab markdown options, loading an HTML source, performing the conversion, and handling common edge cases such as images and tables. By the end of the guide you can confidently run the conversion on any HTML document.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

* Python 3.8 or newer installed.
* `pip` access to install third‑party packages.
* A basic understanding of Markdown syntax.

The only external dependency is **Aspose.HTML for Python via .NET**. Install it with:

```bash
pip install aspose-html
```

> **Pro tip:** Verify the installation by running `python -c "import aspose.html"`; no error means the package is ready.

## Step 1: Create Markdown save options and enable GitLab markdown flavor

The first step is to create a `MarkdownSaveOptions` object and turn on the GitLab‑specific markdown features. Setting `git = True` tells the converter to output GitLab‑compatible syntax, such as task lists and fenced code blocks.

```python
from aspose.html import MarkdownSaveOptions

# Step 1: Create Markdown save options and enable GitLab flavour
md_options = MarkdownSaveOptions()
md_options.git = True   # activates GitLab‑specific markdown features
```

Enabling the **GitLab markdown flavor** ensures that the generated Markdown follows the same rendering rules you see on GitLab.com. Without this flag, the output would follow the default CommonMark specification, which can produce subtle differences in tables or task lists.

## Step 2: Load the source HTML document

Next, load the HTML file you want to convert. The `HTMLDocument` class parses the file and builds a DOM that the converter can walk through.

```python
from aspose.html import HTMLDocument

# Step 2: Load the source HTML document
source_path = "YOUR_DIRECTORY/readme.html"
source_doc = HTMLDocument(source_path)
```

Replace `YOUR_DIRECTORY/readme.html` with the actual path to your HTML file. The `HTMLDocument` constructor automatically resolves relative URLs, so any local images referenced in the HTML will be available for the conversion step.

## Step 3: Convert the HTML document to Markdown using the configured options

Now run the conversion. The static `Converter.convert` method takes the source document, the target file path, and the `MarkdownSaveOptions` you configured earlier.

```python
from aspose.html import Converter

# Step 3: Convert the HTML document to Markdown using the configured options
target_path = "YOUR_DIRECTORY/README.md"
Converter.convert(source_doc, target_path, md_options)
```

When the call finishes, `README.md` contains the Markdown representation of the original HTML, rendered with **GitLab markdown features** such as:

* Task list syntax (`- [ ]` and `- [x]`).
* GitLab‑style tables (pipe‑separated rows with header alignment).
* fenced code blocks with language hints (` ```python `).

### Expected output

Assuming the source HTML contains a simple heading, a paragraph, and a task list, the resulting `README.md` will look like:

```markdown
# Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to convert HTML to Markdown.

- [ ] Install dependencies
- [x] Write conversion script
- [ ] Publish to GitLab
```

The output matches what GitLab renders in its web UI, thanks to the **gitlab markdown flavor** you enabled.

## Handling images and relative links

When your HTML includes `<img>` tags or relative hyperlinks, the converter rewrites them to standard Markdown syntax. However, you must ensure that the referenced assets are accessible from the repository where the Markdown file will live.

```python
# Example: Preserve image paths relative to the target markdown file
md_options.images_folder = "images"   # optional: specify a folder for extracted images
md_options.embed_images = False       # keep images as external files, not base64
```

* `images_folder` tells the converter where to copy extracted images.
* `embed_images = False` keeps the Markdown clean and lets GitLab serve the images directly.

If you prefer embedding images as Base64 (useful for single‑file documentation), set `embed_images = True`. This choice influences the **convert html file** step and may increase the size of the generated Markdown.

## Converting multiple HTML files in a batch

Often you need to **convert HTML files** in bulk, for example when migrating a static site to a GitLab wiki. The same logic applies; you just loop over the files:

```python
import os
from aspose.html import MarkdownSaveOptions, HTMLDocument, Converter

def batch_convert(src_dir: str, dst_dir: str):
    md_options = MarkdownSaveOptions()
    md_options.git = True

    for filename in os.listdir(src_dir):
        if filename.lower().endswith(".html"):
            html_path = os.path.join(src_dir, filename)
            md_path = os.path.join(dst_dir, os.path.splitext(filename)[0] + ".md")
            doc = HTMLDocument(html_path)
            Converter.convert(doc, md_path, md_options)
            print(f"Converted {filename} → {os.path.basename(md_path)}")

# Example usage
batch_convert("YOUR_DIRECTORY/html_pages", "YOUR_DIRECTORY/markdown_pages")
```

The function respects the **gitlab markdown features** for each file, giving you a ready‑to‑commit collection of `.md` files.

## Verifying the conversion

After conversion, open the generated Markdown in a local editor that supports GitLab preview (e.g., VS Code with the *GitLab Workflow* extension) or push it to a temporary GitLab branch. Verify that:

* Tables render with proper column alignment.
* Task lists retain their checkboxes.
* Images display correctly.
* Links point to the expected locations.

If you notice missing assets, double‑check the `images_folder` setting and ensure the image files were copied to the target repository.

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

| Issue | Why it happens | Fix |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| Images appear as broken links | `embed_images` set to `False` but the `images_folder` was not added to the repository | Add the `images` folder to GitLab or switch `embed_images = True`. |
| Tables lose alignment | GitLab markdown requires a header separator line (`---`) | The converter adds it automatically when `git = True`; ensure you didn’t overwrite `md_options` later. |
| Unicode characters become escaped | The source HTML uses a different encoding | Open the HTML with `HTMLDocument(source_path, encoding="utf-8")`. |
| Large HTML files cause memory errors | The library loads the whole DOM into memory | Process the file in chunks or increase the Python memory limit (`PYTHONHASHSEED`). |

Addressing these issues early saves time when you **how to convert HTML** for production use.

## Full script – ready to run

Below is a single‑file script that puts all the steps together. Save it as `convert_html_to_md.py` and run it from the command line.

```python
"""
convert_html_to_md.py

A complete example that converts an HTML file to Markdown using
GitLab markdown flavor. This script demonstrates:
* Enabling GitLab markdown features
* Loading an HTML document
* Converting to Markdown
* Optional handling of images and batch conversion
"""

import os
from aspose.html import MarkdownSaveOptions, HTMLDocument, Converter

def convert_single(html_path: str, md_path: str, embed_images: bool = False):
    """Convert one HTML file to GitLab‑compatible Markdown."""
    md_options = MarkdownSaveOptions()
    md_options.git = True                # enable GitLab markdown flavor
    md_options.embed_images = embed_images
    if not embed_images:
        md_options.images_folder = os.path.dirname(md_path)  # keep images next to .md

    doc = HTMLDocument(html_path)
    Converter.convert(doc, md_path, md_options)
    print(f"Converted: {html_path} → {md_path}")

def batch_convert(src_dir: str, dst_dir: str, embed_images: bool = False):
    """Convert every .html file in src_dir to .md in dst_dir."""
    os.makedirs(dst_dir, exist_ok=True)
    for file in os.listdir(src_dir):
        if file.lower().endswith(".html"):
            src = os.path.join(src_dir, file)
            dst = os.path.join(dst_dir, os.path.splitext(file)[0] + ".md")
            convert_single(src, dst, embed_images)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage – edit paths as needed
    SOURCE_HTML = "YOUR_DIRECTORY/readme.html"
    TARGET_MD = "YOUR_DIRECTORY/README.md"

    # Convert a single file
    convert_single(SOURCE_HTML, TARGET_MD)

    # Uncomment to run a batch conversion
    # batch_convert("YOUR_DIRECTORY/html_pages", "YOUR_DIRECTORY/markdown_pages")
```

Running the script produces `README.md` that respects **GitLab markdown features** and can be committed directly to a GitLab repository.
