# EPUB to XPS Conversion with Aspose.HTML for Java


Are you looking to convert EPUB files to XPS format using Java? Aspose.HTML for Java is here to simplify the process for you. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the entire procedure, from prerequisites to importing necessary packages and breaking down each example into multiple easy-to-follow steps.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from the Oracle website or any other trusted source.

2. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.HTML for Java library from the [Aspose.HTML for Java Documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/html/java/). You can use the [Download Link](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/) for this purpose.

3. IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Choose your favorite Java IDE for coding. IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans are popular choices.

4. EPUB File: You'll need an EPUB file that you want to convert to XPS. Make sure you have this file ready.

## Import Packages

In this step, we will import the necessary packages from the Aspose.HTML library and set up the environment for our conversion task.

### Import Aspose.HTML Packages

```java
import com.aspose.html.saving.XpsSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
```

Now that we have our prerequisites in place and the required packages imported, let's proceed to the example.

In this section, we will break down the process of converting an EPUB file to XPS format into multiple steps.

## Open the EPUB File

```java
try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("input.epub")) {
```

In this step, we open the EPUB file for reading using a `FileInputStream`. Ensure that the EPUB file you want to convert is named "input.epub" or update the file path accordingly.

## Create XpsSaveOptions

```java
XpsSaveOptions options = new XpsSaveOptions();
```

Here, we create an instance of `XpsSaveOptions`, which specifies the options for saving the XPS file.

## Convert EPUB to XPS

```java
Converter.convertEPUB(
    fileInputStream,
    options,
    "output.xps"
);
```

Now, we use the `Converter.convertEPUB` method to convert the EPUB file to XPS format. The method takes the `fileInputStream`, the `options` we created earlier, and the output file name, which in this example is "output.xps." You can change the output file name as needed.

And that's it! You've successfully converted an EPUB file to XPS format using Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to convert EPUB files to XPS format in Java using Aspose.HTML. With the right prerequisites and a simple code example, you can easily integrate this functionality into your Java applications.
