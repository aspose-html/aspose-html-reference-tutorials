# Specifying Custom Stream Provider for EPUB to XPS

In today's digital age, the need to convert EPUB files to other formats, such as XPS, is more common than ever. Aspose.HTML for Java is a powerful tool that can help you achieve this effortlessly. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to convert an EPUB file to XPS using Aspose.HTML for Java. Before we dive into the specifics, let's go over the prerequisites you'll need for this process.

## Prerequisites

To successfully convert EPUB to XPS, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. Aspose.HTML for Java Library

You must have the Aspose.HTML for Java library installed and configured in your Java environment. If you haven't already, you can download the library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

### 2. Input EPUB File

You need an existing EPUB file that you want to convert to XPS. Ensure that you have this file ready for the conversion process.

Now that you have all the prerequisites in place, let's proceed with the step-by-step guide on how to convert your EPUB file to XPS using Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Import Packages

Before you begin, make sure to import the necessary packages for Aspose.HTML for Java to use its functionalities.

```java
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
import com.aspose.html.saving.XpsSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.html.saving.MemoryStreamProvider;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
```

## Open the EPUB File

First, you'll need to open the existing EPUB file for reading. In this step, we'll use a `FileInputStream` to access the EPUB file.

```java
try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/your/input.epub")) {
    // Your code for Step 1
}
```

## Create MemoryStreamProvider

Next, you should create an instance of `MemoryStreamProvider`. This will be used for the conversion process from EPUB to XPS.

```java
try (MemoryStreamProvider streamProvider = new MemoryStreamProvider()) {
    // Your code for Step 2
}
```

## Convert EPUB to XPS

Now, let's convert the EPUB file to XPS using the `Converter.convertEPUB` method.

```java
Converter.convertEPUB(
    fileInputStream,
    new XpsSaveOptions(),
    streamProvider.getStream().findFirst().get()
);
```

## Get Resulted Data

After the conversion is complete, you can access the memory stream that contains the resulted XPS data.

```java
InputStream inputStream = streamProvider.getStream().findFirst().get();
```

## Save the Output

To complete the conversion, you should flush the result data to an output file. In this example, we save it as "output.xps."

```java
try (FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("path/to/your/output.xps")) {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[inputStream.available()];
    inputStream.read(buffer);
    fileOutputStream.write(buffer);
}
```

With these five steps, you've successfully converted your EPUB file to XPS using Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Complete Source Code
```java
        // Open an existing EPUB file for reading.
        try (java.io.FileInputStream fileInputStream = new java.io.FileInputStream(Resources.input("input.epub"))) {
            // Create an instance of MemoryStreamProvider
            try (MemoryStreamProvider streamProvider = new MemoryStreamProvider()) {
                // Convert EPUB to XPS by using the MemoryStreamProvider
                com.aspose.html.converters.Converter.convertEPUB(
                        fileInputStream,
                        new com.aspose.html.saving.XpsSaveOptions(),
                        streamProvider.lStream
                );
                // Get access to the memory stream that contains the resulted data
                java.io.InputStream inputStream = streamProvider.lStream.stream().findFirst().get();
                // Flush the result data to the output file
                try (java.io.FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new java.io.FileOutputStream(Resources.output("output.xps"))) {
                    byte[] buffer = new byte[inputStream.available()];
                    inputStream.read(buffer);
                    fileOutputStream.write(buffer);
                }
            }
        }
```
