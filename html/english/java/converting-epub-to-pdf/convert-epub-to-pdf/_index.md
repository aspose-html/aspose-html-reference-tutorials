## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the technical details of converting EPUB to PDF using Aspose.HTML for Java, you need to ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

## Import Packages

In this section, we'll break down the process into a step-by-step guide format, ensuring that each step is clear and concise. Let's start by importing the necessary packages for our Java application.

### Import Required Packages

First, open your Java project and import the essential Aspose.HTML for Java packages. You need to include the following packages in your Java code:

```java
import com.aspose.html.saving.PdfSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
```

These packages provide the required classes and methods for handling EPUB to PDF conversion.

## Load the EPUB File

Next, you need to load the EPUB file you want to convert to PDF. For this example, we'll assume you have an EPUB file named "input.epub" in your project directory. Make sure to replace it with the actual path to your EPUB file.

```java
try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("input.epub")) {
```

This code opens the EPUB file for reading.

## Set PDF Conversion Options

Create an instance of `PdfSaveOptions` to specify the conversion options for the PDF output.

```java
PdfSaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions();
```

These options allow you to configure various settings for the PDF output, such as page size and margins.

## Convert EPUB to PDF

Now, it's time to perform the actual conversion from EPUB to PDF using Aspose.HTML for Java.

```java
Converter.convertEPUB(fileInputStream, options, "output.pdf");
```

This line of code converts the EPUB file to PDF and saves it as "output.pdf" in your project directory.
