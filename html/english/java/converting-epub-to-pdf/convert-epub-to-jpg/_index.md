# Convert EPUB to JPG with Aspose.HTML for Java


In this step-by-step guide, we'll show you how to convert an EPUB file to JPG images using the Aspose.HTML for Java library. Aspose.HTML for Java is a powerful tool for working with HTML and EPUB files, and it offers a range of features for conversion and manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started with the conversion process, you'll need to ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java SE 8 or later installed on your system.

2. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.HTML for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

3. An EPUB File: You should have an EPUB file that you want to convert to JPG images.

## Import Packages

To begin, you need to import the necessary packages from Aspose.HTML for Java. Here's how to do it:

```java
// Import the required Aspose.HTML for Java packages
import com.aspose.html.saving.ImageSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.html.rendering.image.ImageFormat;
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
```

Now, let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Open the EPUB File

In this step, we'll open the EPUB file for reading using a `FileInputStream`. Replace `'input.epub'` with the path to your EPUB file.

```java
try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("input.epub")) {
    // Your code for the next steps will go here.
}
```

## Step 2: Initialize ImageSaveOptions

We'll initialize the `ImageSaveOptions` to specify the format in which we want to save the images. In this case, we're using JPEG format.

```java
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Jpeg);
```

## Step 3: Convert EPUB to JPG

Now, we'll call the `convertEPUB` method to perform the conversion. This method takes the `FileInputStream` for the EPUB file, the `ImageSaveOptions`, and the output file path.

```java
Converter.convertEPUB(fileInputStream, options, "output.jpg");
```

That's it! You've successfully converted an EPUB file to JPG images using Aspose.HTML for Java.
