# Specifying Custom Stream Provider for EPUB to Image Conversion


Are you ready to harness the power of Aspose.HTML for Java? This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process, step by step. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, we've got you covered. 

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into using Aspose.HTML for Java, there are a few things you need to have in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java properly installed on your system. You can download Java from the website.

2. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: You'll need to obtain the Aspose.HTML for Java library. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

3. Aspose.HTML Documentation: The documentation for Aspose.HTML for Java can be found [here](https://reference.aspose.com/html/java/).

4. IDE (Integrated Development Environment): You can choose any Java-compatible IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

## Import Packages

In this section, we'll guide you through the process of importing the necessary packages to get started with Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Open an Existing EPUB File

First, you need to open an existing EPUB file for reading. Here's how you can do it:

```java
try (java.io.FileInputStream fileInputStream = new java.io.FileInputStream(Resources.input("input.epub"))) {
    // Your code here
}
```

## Create a MemoryStreamProvider

To convert EPUB to an image, you'll need to create an instance of MemoryStreamProvider:

```java
try (MemoryStreamProvider streamProvider = new MemoryStreamProvider()) {
    // Your code here
}
```

## Convert EPUB to Image

Now, let's convert the EPUB file to an image using the MemoryStreamProvider:

```java
com.aspose.html.converters.Converter.convertEPUB(
        fileInputStream,
        new com.aspose.html.saving.ImageSaveOptions(com.aspose.html.rendering.image.ImageFormat.Jpeg),
        streamProvider.lStream
);
```

## Access Memory Streams

You can access the memory streams that contain the resulting data:

```java
int size = streamProvider.lStream.size();
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    java.io.InputStream inputStream = streamProvider.lStream.get(i);
    // Your code here
}
```

## Flush the Page to Output File

Finally, you need to flush the page to the output file:

```java
try (java.io.FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new java.io.FileOutputStream(Resources.output("page_{" + (i + 1) + "}.jpg"))) {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[inputStream.available()];
    inputStream.read(buffer);
    fileOutputStream.write(buffer);
}
```
