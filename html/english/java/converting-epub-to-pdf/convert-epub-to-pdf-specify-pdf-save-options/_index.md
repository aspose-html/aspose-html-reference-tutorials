# Specifying PDF Save Options for EPUB to PDF


## Introduction

Aspose.HTML for Java is a powerful tool for working with HTML and EPUB documents. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of converting an EPUB file to PDF using Aspose.HTML for Java. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just getting started, this tutorial will provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to perform this task efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: You must have a Java development environment set up on your system.

- Aspose.HTML for Java: Download and install the Aspose.HTML for Java library. You can find the library and related documentation on the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

- EPUB File: You'll need an EPUB file that you want to convert to PDF.

Now, let's dive into the step-by-step guide for converting EPUB to PDF using Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Step 1: Open the EPUB File

To begin, open an existing EPUB file for reading. You can use a `FileInputStream` to achieve this. Here's the code for this step:

```java
try (java.io.FileInputStream fileInputStream = new java.io.FileInputStream(Resources.input("input.epub"))) {
    // Your code for the next steps will go here.
}
```

## Step 2: Define PDF Save Options

Create an instance of `PdfSaveOptions` with custom page size and background color. You can configure the page setup according to your requirements. Here's how you can do it:

```java
com.aspose.html.saving.PdfSaveOptions options = new com.aspose.html.saving.PdfSaveOptions();
com.aspose.html.rendering.PageSetup pageSetup = new com.aspose.html.rendering.PageSetup();
com.aspose.html.drawing.Page anyPage = new com.aspose.html.drawing.Page();
anyPage.setSize(new com.aspose.html.drawing.Size(
    com.aspose.html.drawing.Length.fromPixels(3000),
    com.aspose.html.drawing.Length.fromPixels(1000))
);
pageSetup.setAnyPage(anyPage);
options.setPageSetup(pageSetup);
options.setBackgroundColor(com.aspose.html.drawing.Color.getAliceBlue());
```

## Step 3: Convert EPUB to PDF

Now, call the `ConvertEPUB` method to convert the EPUB file to PDF. Specify the input stream, PDF save options, and the output location. Here's how it's done:

```java
com.aspose.html.converters.Converter.convertEPUB(
    fileInputStream,
    options,
    Resources.output("output.pdf")
);
```

Congratulations! You have successfully converted an EPUB file to PDF using Aspose.HTML for Java. You can now access the converted PDF file at the specified output location.
