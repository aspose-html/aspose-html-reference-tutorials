## Introduction
Are you ready to dive into the world of SVG documents with Aspose.HTML for Java? Whether you’re a developer looking to enhance your skills or a designer wanting to automate document handling, this guide is tailor-made for you. SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics, is a powerful format that allows for high-quality graphics on the web. In this tutorial, we will break down the process of saving an SVG document using Aspose.HTML, making it easy to follow and implement.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, let’s ensure you have everything in place. Here’s what you’ll need:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
  
2. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: To work with SVG documents, you need to have the Aspose.HTML library. You can download it from the [Aspose Releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): A good IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans will make coding a lot easier. If you don’t already have one, I recommend IntelliJ IDEA for its user-friendly interface.
4. Basic Knowledge of Java Programming: While we’ll walk through everything step by step, a basic understanding of Java programming will help you grasp the concepts more easily.
Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s jump into the fun part!
## Import Packages
First things first, you’ll need to import the necessary packages from the Aspose.HTML library. Depending on your IDE, this might look slightly different, but here’s a general idea of how to do it:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
```

Now that we have everything set up, let’s go through the process of saving an SVG document step by step.
## Step 1: Prepare the Output Path (H2)
Before you can save your SVG document, you need to specify where it will be stored on your disk. This is done by creating a string that represents the file's path.
```java
String documentPath = "save-to-SVG.svg";
```
In this case, we're saving it in the same directory as our Java application. Feel free to change the path if you want to store it somewhere else.
## Step 2: Write your SVG Code (H2)
Next, you need to create the SVG content. You can write SVG code directly as a string in your Java program.
```java
String code = "<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' height='200' width='300'>" +
    "<g fill='none' stroke-width= '10' stroke-dasharray='30 10'>" +
        "<path stroke='red' d='M 25 40 l 215 0' />" +
        "<path stroke='black' d='M 35 80 l 215 0' />" +
        "<path stroke='blue' d='M 45 120 l 215 0' />" +
    "</g>" +
"</svg>";
```
Here, we are defining a simple SVG graphic with three colored lines. This is where your creativity can shine! You can modify the SVG code to create whatever design you want.
## Step 3: Initialize the SVG Document (H2)
With your SVG code ready, the next step is to create an instance of the `SVGDocument` class. This class will help us manage our SVG content.
```java
com.aspose.html.dom.svg.SVGDocument document = new com.aspose.html.dom.svg.SVGDocument(code, ".");
```
The first parameter is the SVG code, and the second is the base URI. In this case, we’re using `"."` to signify the current directory.
## Step 4: Save the SVG File (H2)
Finally, we can save the SVG document to the specified path using the `save` method.
```java
document.save(documentPath);
```
This command does just what it sounds like – it saves your SVG document to the location you defined earlier. Congratulations! You’re now equipped to handle SVG files programmatically.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we’ve walked you through the entire process of saving an SVG document using Aspose.HTML for Java. From setting up your environment and importing necessary packages to writing and saving your SVG code, you now have a solid foundation in working with SVG files. SVG graphics are not just powerful; they’re also a lot of fun to create and manipulate! So go ahead, unleash your creativity, and experiment with your designs.
