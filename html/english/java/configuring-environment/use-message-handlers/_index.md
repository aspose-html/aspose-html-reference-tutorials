# Use Message Handlers in Aspose.HTML for Java

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll walk you through a practical example of using message handlers in Aspose.HTML for Java. We’ll prepare a simple HTML document that references a missing image and demonstrate how to catch and handle the error using a custom message handler. Whether you're new to Aspose.HTML or looking to expand your skills, this guide will give you the insights you need to manage network operations effectively.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the step-by-step guide, let's make sure you have everything you need:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Aspose.HTML for Java: You’ll need to have Aspose.HTML for Java installed. You can download it from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
3. IDE: Use your favorite Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
4. Basic Knowledge of Java: Familiarity with Java programming is essential to follow this tutorial effectively.
5. Temporary License: If you're using the trial version of Aspose.HTML, consider obtaining a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) to avoid any limitations during development.

## Import Packages
Before we begin, make sure you have the necessary packages imported into your Java project. Below are the essential imports you’ll need:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
```
These imports will give you access to the classes and methods required for handling network operations, creating HTML documents, and performing the HTML-to-PNG conversion.

## Step 1: Prepare the HTML Code
The first thing we need is a simple HTML code that references an image file. We’ll deliberately reference an image that doesn’t exist to trigger the error handling mechanism.
```java
String code = "<img src='missing.jpg'>";
```
This code snippet creates an HTML element that tries to load an image named `missing.jpg`. Since this image file doesn’t exist, it will trigger an error during the document loading process.
## Step 2: Write the HTML Code to a File
Next, we need to write this HTML code to a file that we can load later.
```java
try (java.io.FileWriter fileWriter = new java.io.FileWriter("document.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(code);
}
```
Here, we use a `FileWriter` to write our HTML code to a file named `document.html`. This file will be used to create an HTML document in the following steps.
## Step 3: Create a Custom Message Handler
Now, let’s create a custom message handler to handle the missing image scenario. The message handler will check the status code of the response and print a message if the file isn’t found.
```java
com.aspose.html.net.MessageHandler handler = new com.aspose.html.net.MessageHandler() {
    @Override
    public void invoke(com.aspose.html.net.INetworkOperationContext context) {
        if (context.getResponse().getStatusCode() != 200) {
            System.out.println(String.format("File '%s' Not Found", context.getRequest().getRequestUri().toString()));
        }
        invoke(context);
    }
};
```
In this handler, the `invoke` method checks the status code of the network operation's response. If the status code is not 200 (which indicates success), it prints a message indicating that the file was not found. The `invoke(context);` line ensures that the next handler in the chain is called.
## Step 4: Configure the Network Service
To use our custom message handler, we need to add it to the chain of existing message handlers in the network service. This is done through the `Configuration` class.
```java
com.aspose.html.Configuration configuration = new com.aspose.html.Configuration();
try {
    com.aspose.html.services.INetworkService network = configuration.getService(com.aspose.html.services.INetworkService.class);
    network.getMessageHandlers().addItem(handler);
```
Here, we create an instance of `Configuration` and retrieve the `INetworkService`. Then, we add our custom handler to the list of message handlers. This setup ensures that our handler is invoked during network operations.
## Step 5: Load the HTML Document
With the configuration in place, we can now load our HTML document. The document will try to load the missing image, triggering our custom message handler.
```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument("document.html", configuration);
try {
    // Additional operations will go here
} finally {
    if (document != null) {
        document.dispose();
    }
}
```
This snippet loads the HTML document using the configuration we set up earlier. The document's loading process will attempt to load the missing image, and our message handler will catch and handle the resulting error.
## Step 6: Convert HTML to PNG
To wrap things up, let’s convert the HTML document to a PNG image. This step isn’t strictly necessary for handling the missing image, but it demonstrates the broader functionality of Aspose.HTML.
```java
com.aspose.html.converters.Converter.convertHTML(
    document,
    new com.aspose.html.saving.ImageSaveOptions(),
    "output.png"
);
```
Here, we use the `Converter.convertHTML` method to convert the HTML document to a PNG file. The `ImageSaveOptions` allows us to specify options for saving the image, such as resolution and format.
## Step 7: Clean Up Resources
Finally, always ensure that you clean up any resources used during the process. This includes disposing of the `Configuration` and `HTMLDocument` objects.
```java
} finally {
    if (configuration != null) {
        configuration.dispose();
    }
}
```
This ensures that all resources are released, preventing memory leaks and other potential issues in your application.

## Conclusion
And there you have it—a comprehensive guide on using message handlers in Aspose.HTML for Java! We’ve walked through the process of setting up an HTML document, creating a custom message handler, and handling missing resources like a pro. Whether you’re dealing with missing images, broken links, or other network-related issues, this approach will give you the control you need to manage them effectively in your Java applications.

## FAQs
### What is Aspose.HTML for Java?
Aspose.HTML for Java is a powerful library that allows developers to create, manipulate, and convert HTML documents in Java applications.
