# Create PDF from HTML – Set User Style Sheet in Aspose.HTML for Java

## Introduction
In this tutorial you’ll learn how to **create PDF from HTML** using Aspose.HTML for Java while applying a custom user stylesheet.  
Ever found yourself wanting to tweak the appearance of your HTML documents with your own unique style? Imagine you’re crafting a webpage and you need headings to pop with a specific color or paragraphs to look consistent across devices. This is where a *user stylesheet* and the **User Agent Service** come into play. We’ll walk through every step—from writing a simple HTML file, configuring the user agent, to finally **convert HTML to PDF**—so you can see the result instantly.

## Quick Answers
- **What does “create PDF from HTML” mean?** It means rendering an HTML document (with CSS, images, fonts, etc.) and saving the visual output as a PDF file.  
- **Which Aspose component is required?** The Aspose.HTML for Java library provides the conversion engine and the User Agent Service.  
- **Do I need a license for testing?** A free trial works for development; a commercial license is required for production.  
- **Can I use an external CSS file?** Yes – you can link external stylesheets just like in a regular browser.  
- **How long does the conversion take?** For a simple document like the one in this guide, conversion completes in under a second.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following:

1. **Aspose.HTML for Java** – download the latest JAR from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).  
2. **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+** – ensure `java -version` reports 8 or higher.  
3. **IDE** – IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans will work fine.  
4. **Basic HTML/CSS knowledge** – helpful but not mandatory.

## Import Packages
To start, import the essential Java classes. The only explicit import you need for this example is `java.io.IOException`; the Aspose classes are referenced with fully‑qualified names later.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Create a Simple HTML Document
First, we’ll write a minimal HTML file (`document.html`) that will serve as the source for our PDF conversion.

```java
String code = "<h1>User Agent Service</h1>\r\n" +
        "<p>The User Agent Service allows you to specify a custom user stylesheet, a primary character set for the document, language, and fonts settings.</p>\r\n";
try (java.io.FileWriter fileWriter = new java.io.FileWriter("document.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(code);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

> **Pro tip:** Keep the HTML file in the same directory as your Java source to avoid path‑related headaches.

## Step 2: Set Up Aspose.HTML Configuration
Create a `Configuration` object. This object acts as a container for all services (including the User Agent Service) that you’ll use later.

```java
com.aspose.html.Configuration configuration = new com.aspose.html.Configuration();
```

## Step 3: Access the User Agent Service  
The **User Agent Service** lets you inject a custom stylesheet, set the default character set, and control other rendering options.

```java
com.aspose.html.services.IUserAgentService userAgent = configuration.getService(com.aspose.html.services.IUserAgentService.class);
```

## Step 4: Define and Apply the User Stylesheet  
Now we provide the CSS rules that will style the HTML when it’s rendered. This is where we **use user agent service** to set the stylesheet.

```java
userAgent.setUserStyleSheet("h1 { color:#a52a2a; font-size:2em; }\r\n" +
        "p { background-color:GhostWhite; color:SlateGrey; font-size:1.2em; }\r\n");
```

> **Why this matters:** By applying a stylesheet at the user‑agent level, you ensure the styles are respected even if the original HTML doesn’t reference a CSS file.

## Step 5: Load the HTML Document with the Custom Configuration  
Pass both the file path and the `Configuration` instance to the `HTMLDocument` constructor. This binds the user stylesheet to the document.

```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument("document.html", configuration);
```

## Step 6: Convert HTML to PDF  
With the document fully styled, invoke the static `convertHTML` method to **convert HTML to PDF**. The `PdfSaveOptions` object lets you fine‑tune the output (e.g., page size, compression).

```java
com.aspose.html.converters.Converter.convertHTML(
        document,
        new com.aspose.html.saving.PdfSaveOptions(),
        "user-agent-stylesheet_out.pdf"
);
```

> **Result:** `user-agent-stylesheet_out.pdf` will contain the heading in brown and the paragraph with a GhostWhite background, exactly as defined in the stylesheet.

## Step 7: Clean Up Resources  
Always dispose of Aspose objects to free native memory.

```java
if (document != null) {
    document.dispose();
}
if (configuration != null) {
    configuration.dispose();
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions
| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **Blank PDF output** | No stylesheet applied or document not loaded with configuration. | Verify that `configuration` is passed to `HTMLDocument` and that `setUserStyleSheet` is called before loading. |
| **Unsupported CSS property warning** | Aspose.HTML doesn’t support some advanced CSS features. | Use only CSS properties listed in the Aspose.HTML documentation or fallback to simpler styles. |
| **FileNotFoundException** | Wrong path to `document.html`. | Use an absolute path or place the HTML file in the project root. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I apply different styles for different HTML elements?**  
A: Absolutely! You can define as many CSS rules as you need within the user stylesheet.

**Q: What if I need to change the stylesheet dynamically?**  
A: Call `setUserStyleSheet` again before creating a new `HTMLDocument` instance; the new styles will be applied on the next conversion.

**Q: Is it possible to use external CSS files with Aspose.HTML for Java?**  
A: Yes – you can either link an external stylesheet in the HTML or load its content and pass it to `setUserStyleSheet`.

**Q: How does Aspose.HTML handle unsupported CSS properties?**  
A: Unsupported properties are ignored, allowing the rest of the stylesheet to render without errors.

**Q: Can I convert HTML to formats other than PDF?**  
A: Yes, Aspose.HTML supports conversion to XPS, TIFF, PNG, JPEG, and more using the appropriate `SaveOptions` class.

## Conclusion
You’ve now seen how to **create PDF from HTML** by setting a custom user stylesheet with Aspose.HTML for Java. This workflow gives you full control over the visual appearance of the generated PDF, making it ideal for automated report generation, invoice creation, or any scenario where consistent styling is crucial. Feel free to experiment with more complex CSS, external fonts, or additional conversion formats to extend this foundation.
