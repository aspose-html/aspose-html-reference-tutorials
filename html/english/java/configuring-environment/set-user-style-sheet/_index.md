# Set User Style Sheet in Aspose.HTML for Java

## Introduction
Ever found yourself wanting to tweak the appearance of your HTML documents with your own unique style? Imagine you’re crafting a webpage, and you want to ensure the headings pop with a certain color or the paragraphs have a consistent look across different devices. This is where user stylesheets come into play! In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to set a custom user stylesheet using Aspose.HTML for Java. Whether you’re looking to create a cohesive design for your documents or simply experimenting with different styles, this guide will walk you through the entire process in a simple and engaging way.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let’s make sure you have everything you need to follow along:
1. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: If you haven’t already, you can download it from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
2. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your machine.
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to write and run your Java code.
4. Basic Knowledge of HTML and CSS: A little familiarity with HTML and CSS will help you understand the styling process better.

## Import Packages
To get started with Aspose.HTML for Java, you’ll need to import the necessary packages. These imports will allow you to create and manipulate HTML documents, configure the user agent service, and handle conversions.
```java
import java.io.IOException;
```
## Step 1: Create an HTML Document
First, you'll need to create an HTML document where you can apply your custom stylesheet. This step involves writing a simple HTML code to a file.
You’ll start by writing some basic HTML code to a file named `document.html`. This file will serve as the base for your custom styles.
```java
String code = "<h1>User Agent Service</h1>\r\n" +
        "<p>The User Agent Service allows you to specify a custom user stylesheet, a primary character set for the document, language, and fonts settings.</p>\r\n";
try (java.io.FileWriter fileWriter = new java.io.FileWriter("document.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(code);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
Here, you’re creating a simple HTML file with a heading and a paragraph. The `FileWriter` is used to write this code into `document.html`.
## Step 2: Set Up Configuration
The next step involves setting up a configuration that will allow you to customize the user stylesheet. This is done using the `com.aspose.html.Configuration` class.
You need to create an instance of the `Configuration` class to access various services provided by Aspose.HTML for Java.
```java
com.aspose.html.Configuration configuration = new com.aspose.html.Configuration();
```
This configuration instance will act as the backbone for applying the custom styles.
## Step 3: Access the User Agent Service
Once the configuration is set up, the next step is to access the `IUserAgentService`. This service is essential for setting the custom stylesheet.
Using the configuration instance, you’ll retrieve the `IUserAgentService` which allows you to define the custom styles.
```java
com.aspose.html.services.IUserAgentService userAgent = configuration.getService(com.aspose.html.services.IUserAgentService.class);
```
Here, the `getService` method is utilized to get the user agent service, which will be used in the next step to apply the custom styles.
## Step 4: Define and Apply the User Stylesheet
Now, it’s time to define your custom CSS styles and apply them to the HTML document using the `IUserAgentService`.

You can define your custom styles using CSS and then set these styles to the `userAgent` service.
```java
userAgent.setUserStyleSheet("h1 { color:#a52a2a; font-size:2em; }\r\n" +
        "p { background-color:GhostWhite; color:SlateGrey; font-size:1.2em; }\r\n");
```
In this example, the heading (`h1`) is styled with a brown color and a larger font size, while the paragraph (`p`) has a light background and grey text. This custom stylesheet is then set for the user agent service.
## Step 5: Initialize the HTML Document with Configuration
With the custom stylesheet in place, the next step is to initialize an HTML document using the specified configuration.

You’ll create a new instance of `HTMLDocument`, passing in the file path and the configuration.
```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument("document.html", configuration);
```
This initialization applies your custom user stylesheet to the HTML document, ensuring that all the styles are reflected when the document is rendered or converted.
## Step 6: Convert HTML to PDF
Finally, you might want to convert the styled HTML document to a different format, such as PDF. Aspose.HTML for Java makes this conversion process straightforward.

You can easily convert the HTML document to PDF using the `Converter` class.
```java
com.aspose.html.converters.Converter.convertHTML(
        document,
        new com.aspose.html.saving.PdfSaveOptions(),
        "user-agent-stylesheet_out.pdf"
);
```
In this step, the `convertHTML` method takes the document, some save options, and the output file name as parameters, converting your HTML file into a PDF with the applied styles.
## Step 7: Clean Up Resources
After the conversion, it’s essential to clean up the resources to avoid memory leaks.

Ensure you dispose of the `HTMLDocument` and `Configuration` instances once you’re done.
```java
if (document != null) {
    document.dispose();
}
if (configuration != null) {
    configuration.dispose();
}
```
This step ensures that all resources are properly released, maintaining the efficiency of your application.
