## Prerequisites

Before diving into this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure you have Java JDK installed on your system.

- Aspose.HTML for Java Library: Download and install Aspose.HTML for Java from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

- IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Any Java IDE of your choice, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

With these prerequisites met, you're ready to explore the HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript manipulation using Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Import Packages

First, let's import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.HTML for Java. The following code snippet demonstrates the import process:

```java
import com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument;
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
import com.aspose.html.saving.PdfSaveOptions;
import java.io.FileWriter;
```

With the packages imported, you're ready to start working with HTML5 Canvas.


## Step 1: Create a Canvas Element

In this step, you will create an HTML5 Canvas element and initialize it within a JavaScript script.

### Step 1.1: Prepare the HTML and JavaScript

```java
String code = "<canvas id='myCanvas' width='200' height='100' style='border:1px solid #d3d3d3;'></canvas>\n" +
              "<script>\n" +
              "    var c = document.getElementById('myCanvas');\n" +
              "    var context = c.getContext('2d');\n" +
              "    context.font = '20px Arial';\n" +
              "    context.fillStyle = 'red';\n" +
              "    context.fillText('Hello World', 40, 50);\n" +
              "</script>\n";
```

### Step 1.2: Save the HTML Code to a File

Now, save the HTML code you've prepared to a file named `document.html`.

```java
try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("document.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(code);
}
```

## Step 2: Initialize an HTML Document

In this step, you will use Aspose.HTML to initialize an HTML document from the HTML file you've just created.

```java
HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument("document.html");
```

## Step 3: Convert HTML to PDF

Now, it's time to convert the HTML document to a PDF using Aspose.HTML.

```java
try {
    Converter.convertHTML(
        document,
        new PdfSaveOptions(),
        "output.pdf"
    );
} finally {
    if (document != null) {
        document.dispose();
    }
}
```

Congratulations! You've successfully created an HTML document with a Canvas element, drawn on it using JavaScript, and converted it to a PDF using Aspose.HTML for Java.
