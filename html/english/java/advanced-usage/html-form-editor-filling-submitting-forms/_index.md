In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize Aspose.HTML for Java to fill and submit HTML forms on a target website.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the steps of filling and submitting HTML forms using Aspose.HTML for Java, you should ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: You need a working Java development environment, including JDK and IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

2. Aspose.HTML for Java: Download and install Aspose.HTML for Java from the website. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

3. IDE Configuration: Make sure your IDE is configured correctly to use Aspose.HTML for Java in your Java project.

## Importing Required Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages to use Aspose.HTML for Java effectively. Here's how you can do it:

```java
// Import required packages
import com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument;
import com.aspose.html.forms.FormEditor;
import com.aspose.html.forms.FormSubmitter;
import com.aspose.html.forms.SubmissionResult;
import com.aspose.html.forms.TextAreaElement;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

Now, let's break down the process of filling and submitting HTML forms using Aspose.HTML for Java into step-by-step instructions:

### Step 1: Initialize an HTML Document

To get started, initialize an instance of an HTML document from the URL of the web page containing the form you want to manipulate. In this example, we'll use 'https://httpbin.org/forms/post'.

```java
HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument("https://httpbin.org/forms/post");
```

### Step 2: Create a Form Editor

Create an instance of the FormEditor to interact with the HTML form elements on the web page.

```java
FormEditor editor = FormEditor.create(document, 0);
```

### Step 3: Fill Form Data

You can fill the form data in multiple ways, depending on your preferences:

- Directly access input elements by name and set their values:

```java
editor.get_Item("custname").setValue("John Doe");
```

- Access specific elements and set their values:

```java
TextAreaElement comments = editor.getElement(TextAreaElement.class, "comments");
comments.setValue("MORE CHEESE PLEASE!");
```

- Fill multiple form fields at once using a map:

```java
Map<String, String> formData = new HashMap<>();
formData.put("custemail", "john.doe@gmail.com");
formData.put("custtel", "+1202-555-0290");
editor.fill(formData);
```

### Step 4: Create a Form Submitter

Create an instance of FormSubmitter to handle the submission of the form.

```java
FormSubmitter submitter = new FormSubmitter(editor);
```

### Step 5: Submit the Form Data

Submit the form data to the remote server. You can specify additional options, such as user credentials and timeouts if needed.

```java
SubmissionResult result = submitter.submit();
```

### Step 6: Handle the Result

Check the status of the result object and process the response accordingly. Depending on the server's response, you can choose to handle JSON or HTML data.

```java
if (result.isSuccess()) {
    if (result.getResponseMessage().getHeaders().getContentType().getMediaType().equals("application/json")) {
        // Handle JSON response
        System.out.println(result.getContent().readAsString());
    } else {
        // Handle HTML response
        com.aspose.html.dom.Document resultDocument = result.loadDocument();
        // Inspect the HTML document here
        System.out.println(resultDocument.getDocumentElement().getTextContent());
    }
}
```
