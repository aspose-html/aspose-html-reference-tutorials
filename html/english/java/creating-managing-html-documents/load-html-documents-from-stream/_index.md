# Load HTML Documents from Stream with Aspose.HTML for Java

## Introduction
When it comes to working with HTML documents in Java, developers often find themselves in need of reliable and efficient libraries. One such powerful tool is Aspose.HTML for Java. This library offers an impressive array of features to manipulate and convert HTML content seamlessly. In this tutorial, we’ll dive into how to load HTML documents from a stream and save them to a file using Aspose.HTML, providing you with clear, step-by-step instructions.
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of the code, let’s get you set up with everything you’ll need:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. JDK version 8 or above will work perfectly with Aspose.HTML.
- Aspose.HTML for Java: You need the Aspose.HTML library. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to make coding more comfortable. 
- Basic Understanding of Java: Familiarity with Java programming concepts will help you understand the implementation better.
Let’s break this down into an easy-to-follow guide.
## Step 1: Prepare the HTML Content
Before loading from a stream, you first need some HTML content. In this case, we will use a simple HTML string.
```java
String code = "<p>Hello World! I love HTML!</p>";
```
### Explanation
Here, we’re creating a `String` variable named `code` that contains basic HTML content wrapped in paragraph tags. This acts as our source for the stream.
## Step 2: Create an InputStream from the HTML String
Next, we need to convert our HTML string into an `InputStream`.
```java
java.io.InputStream is = new java.io.ByteArrayInputStream(code.getBytes());
```

The `ByteArrayInputStream` takes the bytes from our `String` and turns it into a stream. This is crucial because Aspose.HTML processes documents from input streams.
## Step 3: Initialize the HTML Document
Now it's time to initialize the HTML document using the stream we've just created.
```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument(is, ".");
```

Here, we create an `HTMLDocument` object by passing in our input stream. The second parameter represents the base path (in our case, it's just `"."`, meaning the current directory). It allows the library to resolve any paths or resources referenced in the HTML content.
## Step 4: Save the Document to Disk
Once the document is loaded into the `HTMLDocument` object, you can save it to your local disk.
```java
document.save("load-from-stream.html");
```

The `save()` method writes the HTML document to a specified file name, in this case, `load-from-stream.html`. After executing this code, you’ll find your HTML file in the same directory where your code is running.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You've successfully loaded an HTML document from a stream using Aspose.HTML for Java and saved it to your disk. This approach opens up a ton of possibilities like generating HTML content dynamically, processing HTML from various sources, and integrating it into larger projects.
