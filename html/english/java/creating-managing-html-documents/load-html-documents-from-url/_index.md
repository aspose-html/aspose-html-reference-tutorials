# Load HTML Documents from URL in Aspose.HTML for Java

## Introduction
Welcome! If you've landed here, you're probably looking to dive into the fascinating world of HTML manipulation using Aspose.HTML for Java. Allow me to take you on an exciting journey where we’ll explore how to load HTML documents directly from a URL. The flexibility of working with HTML in Java can be a game-changer, whether you’re developing a web application, extracting content, or simply experimenting with document processing.
In this tutorial, we’ll not only touch the surface of loading HTML but also break it down into easy-to-follow steps. You’ll walk away with clear insights and practical examples, making this a valuable addition to your programming toolkit.
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the code, let’s make sure you have everything you need:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or above installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Maven: For easy dependency management, having Apache Maven installed is a plus. You can [get it here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
3. Aspose.HTML for Java: You’ll need the Aspose.HTML library to handle HTML documents. Get it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/). 
4. An IDE: A good integrated development environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse will simplify your coding experience.
5. Basic Knowledge of Java: Familiarity with Java programming will help you understand the examples more easily.
Now that we’ve checked off our prerequisites, let’s get our hands dirty!
## Import Packages
To start working with the Aspose.HTML library, we need to import the relevant packages into our Java project. Here’s how you do it:
## Step 1: Create a Maven Project
1. Open your IDE and create a new Maven project.
2. In your `pom.xml` file, add the Aspose.HTML dependency:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
       <artifactId>aspose-html</artifactId>
       <version>21.10</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
   </dependency>
```
## Step 2: Import Required Packages
Once your project is set up, you need to import the necessary classes in your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument;
```
These two steps set the stage for working with HTML documents. With the imports done, we're ready to load an HTML document from a URL!
## Load HTML Documents from URL
Now let’s get to the exciting part! We’re going to load an HTML document from a URL and print its outer HTML. Follow these detailed steps, and you'll be loading HTML like a pro in no time.
## Step 1: Create a New Java Class
First, let’s create a new class called `LoadHtmlFromUrl`. This is where our main logic will reside.
```java
public class LoadHtmlFromUrl {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code will go here!
    }
}
```
## Step 2: Instantiate the HTMLDocument Object
Inside the `main` method, we’ll create an instance of the `HTMLDocument` class. This allows us to fetch the HTML content from the specified URL.
```java
public class LoadHtmlFromUrl {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument("https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/creating-a-document/document.html");
    }
}
```
## Step 3: Access the Document Element
Once you have your `document` object, it's time to access the document element. Here’s where you begin to see the power of Aspose.HTML for Java. You can get the entire outer HTML of the document.
```java
System.out.println(document.getDocumentElement().getOuterHTML());
```
## Step 4: Run Your Program
Now that we’ve written the code, it’s time to test if everything works! Simply run your program, and you should see the entire outer HTML of the loaded document printed in the console.
## Complete Example Code
Here’s the full code snippet for loading HTML from a URL:
```java
import com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument;
public class LoadHtmlFromUrl {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument("https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/creating-a-document/document.html");
        System.out.println(document.getDocumentElement().getOuterHTML());
    }
}
```
