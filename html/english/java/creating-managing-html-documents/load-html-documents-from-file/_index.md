## Introduction
Are you ready to dive into the world of HTML document manipulation? Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, understanding how to handle HTML files programmatically can open up a plethora of opportunities for your projects. This guide focuses on how to load HTML documents from a file using Aspose.HTML for Java, providing you with all the necessary steps and tips you need. From setting up your environment to executing your first successful document load, I’m here to help you every step of the way.
## Prerequisites
Before we roll up our sleeves and jump into the code, let's ensure that you have everything you need to get started:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Install the latest version of the JDK. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- Aspose.HTML for Java library: This is the core library we’ll be using. You can find it available for download [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Use your preferred IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for coding.
- Basic Knowledge of Java: Familiarity with Java programming and object-oriented principles will be beneficial.
Alright, got your setup ready? Let’s move on!

By importing these packages, you’re telling Java which classes and libraries you’ll be using. The `HTMLDocument` class is essential for working with HTML files, while the `FileWriter` class is crucial for creating a file.
## Creating an HTML File
Before we can actually load an HTML file, we need to create one. Think of it as prepping the canvas before starting your masterpiece.
## Step 1: Create an HTML File
In the body of your Java program, let's create a quick HTML file named "load-from-file.html" with the following code:
```java
try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("load-from-file.html")) {
    fileWriter.write("<html><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>");
}
```
This code snippet does a couple of things:
- It opens a new file called "load-from-file.html".
- It writes a simple HTML structure that contains a "Hello World!" message.
This is your starting point – the HTML document you’ll be loading!
## Loading the HTML Document
Now comes the exciting part – loading our newly created HTML document into the Aspose.HTML framework using Java.
## Step 2: Load the HTML File
With your HTML file created, the next step is to load it into your program:
```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument("load-from-file.html");
```
By initializing an `HTMLDocument` object with the file path, you’re inviting the Aspose.HTML library to read the HTML content.
## Step 3: Output the Loaded Document
To check that everything is working smoothly, let’s print the contents of the document to the console:
```java
System.out.println(document.getDocumentElement().getOuterHTML());
```
