# Advanced File Loading for HTML Documents in Aspose.HTML for Java

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the process of loading HTML documents from a file using Aspose.HTML for Java. But hold on, we’re not just going to load any HTML file—we’re going to load it, manipulate it, and save it with a new name! By the end of this guide, you’ll have a solid grasp of how to handle HTML documents with ease, and you’ll be itching to dive into more advanced features.
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty details, let's make sure you have everything you need to follow along. Here’s your checklist:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) Installed: Make sure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You’ll need an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. This will make your coding experience smoother.
3. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: You need to have Aspose.HTML for Java installed. If you don’t have it yet, download the library from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
4. Basic Understanding of HTML and Java: This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of HTML structure and Java programming. If you’re new to either, you might want to brush up on the basics first.
5. Temporary License: To fully unlock the capabilities of Aspose.HTML for Java, consider obtaining a temporary license. You can get one from the [Aspose website](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

## Step 1: Prepare the HTML File Path
First things first, you need to tell your program where to find the HTML file you want to work with. This is as simple as specifying the file path in your code.
```java
// Prepare a path to the HTML file
String documentPath = "Sprite.html";
```
In this step, we define a `String` variable named `documentPath` and assign it the file path of the HTML document you want to load. Make sure the path points to the correct location where your HTML file is stored. If your file is in the same directory as your Java program, you can just use the file name. Otherwise, use the full path.
## Step 2: Initialize the HTML Document
Now that you have the path to your file, it’s time to load the HTML document into your program. This is where Aspose.HTML for Java shines, making the process straightforward and efficient.
```java
// Initialize an HTML document from a file
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument(documentPath);
```
Here, we create an instance of the `HTMLDocument` class, passing the file path to its constructor. This loads the content of your HTML file into the `document` object. Think of it as opening a book—you now have access to every element, tag, and piece of content in that HTML file.
## Step 3: Save the HTML Document with a New Name
Once you’ve loaded the document and potentially made some changes, you’ll want to save it. But why overwrite the original file when you can save it with a new name?
```java
// Save the document with a new name
document.save("Sprite_out.html");
```
In this final step, we call the `save` method on our `document` object, passing in a new file name, `"Sprite_out.html"`. This saves the HTML content into a new file. It’s like hitting “Save As” in a text editor—you’ve got the same content, but under a new name.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve successfully loaded, potentially manipulated, and saved an HTML document using Aspose.HTML for Java. Not only did you see how easy it is to work with HTML files in Java, but you also got a glimpse into the power of Aspose.HTML for Java, a library that simplifies complex HTML processing tasks.
Whether you’re building a web scraper, an HTML editor, or simply need to automate HTML document processing, Aspose.HTML for Java is a tool that should definitely be in your toolkit.
