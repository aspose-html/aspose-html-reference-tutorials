## Introduction
When it comes to web development, handling document load events is crucial for ensuring that your application runs smoothly and efficiently. If you're working with HTML documents in Java, Aspose.HTML provides a powerful library that allows you to manipulate HTML documents with ease. In this tutorial, we will explore how to handle document load events using Aspose.HTML for Java. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the coding part, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Aspose.HTML for Java: You need to have the Aspose.HTML library. You can download the latest version from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).
3. IDE: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse will make your coding experience smoother.
4. Basic Java Knowledge: Familiarity with Java programming and event handling concepts will be helpful.
5. Internet Connection: Since we will be navigating to an online document, ensure you have a stable internet connection.
Once you have these prerequisites in place, you’re ready to start coding!

Now that we have everything set up, let’s break down the process of handling document load events into manageable steps.
## Step 1: Initialize an HTML Document
The first step is to create an instance of the `HTMLDocument` class. This class represents the HTML document that you will be working with.
```java
com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument document = new com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument();
java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean isLoading = new java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean(false);
```
In this snippet, we also create an `AtomicBoolean` variable named `isLoading`. This variable will help us track whether the document is currently loading.
## Step 2: Subscribe to the 'OnLoad' Event
Next, we need to subscribe to the `OnLoad` event of the document. This event is triggered when the document has fully loaded. 
```java
document.OnLoad.add(new DOMEventHandler() {
    @Override
    public void invoke(Object o, Event event) {
        isLoading.set(true);
    }
});
```
Here, we add a new event handler that sets `isLoading` to `true` when the document is fully loaded. This allows us to perform actions once the document is ready.
## Step 3: Navigate to the Document
Now, it’s time to navigate to the HTML document that you want to load. In this example, we will load a document from a specified URI.
```java
document.navigate("https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/creating-a-document/document.html");
```
This line of code tells the document to load the content from the provided URL. However, keep in mind that the document may not be loaded immediately.
## Step 4: Wait for the Document to Load
Since loading a document from a URL is an asynchronous operation, we need to wait for a few seconds to ensure that the document has enough time to load. 
```java
Thread.sleep(5000);
```
In this case, we use `Thread.sleep(5000)` to pause the execution for 5 seconds. This is a simple way to wait, but in production code, you might want to implement a more robust solution using callbacks or future tasks.
## Step 5: Access the Loaded Document
Finally, once the document is loaded, you can access its content. For example, we can print the outer HTML of the document to the console:
```java
System.out.println("outerHTML = " + document.getDocumentElement().getOuterHTML());
```
This line retrieves the outer HTML of the document and prints it. You can manipulate this HTML further based on your application’s needs.
## Conclusion
Handling document load events in Aspose.HTML for Java is a straightforward process that involves initializing an HTML document, subscribing to load events, navigating to a URL, and accessing the loaded content. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can effectively manage document loading in your Java applications.
Aspose.HTML is a powerful library that opens up numerous possibilities for working with HTML documents. Whether you’re building a web application or processing HTML content, this library can significantly simplify your workflow.
