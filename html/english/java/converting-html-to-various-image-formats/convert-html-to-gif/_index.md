Aspose.HTML for Java is a powerful tool that allows you to seamlessly convert HTML documents into a variety of formats, including GIF. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of converting an HTML document into a GIF image using Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.HTML for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/). Ensure you have a valid license or use the [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) if needed.

2. Java Development Environment: You should have a Java development environment set up on your system.

3. Basic Knowledge of HTML: Familiarity with HTML is essential as you'll be working with HTML documents.

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages from Aspose.HTML for Java:

```java

```

## Converting HTML to GIF â€“ Step by Step

Let's break down the process of converting an HTML document to a GIF image into multiple steps:

### Step 1: Prepare an HTML Code

```java
String code = "<span>Hello</span> <span>World!!</span>";
try (java.io.FileWriter fileWriter = new java.io.FileWriter("document.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(code);
}
```

In this step, we create a simple HTML code containing the text "Hello World!!" and save it to a file named "document.html."

### Step 2: Initialize an HTML Document

```java
HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument("document.html");
```

We initialize an HTML document by loading the HTML file created in Step 1.

### Step 3: Initialize ImageSaveOptions

```java
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Gif);
```

Here, we create an `ImageSaveOptions` object and specify the output format as GIF.

### Step 4: Convert HTML to GIF

```java
Converter.convertHTML(document, options, "output.gif");
```

In this final step, we use the `Converter` class to convert the HTML document into a GIF image with the given options. The output GIF image will be saved as "output.gif."
