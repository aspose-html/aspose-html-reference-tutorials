# HTML to JPG Conversion with Aspose.HTML for Java


In the digital age, transforming HTML content into various formats is a common need. Aspose.HTML for Java is a powerful library that simplifies the process of converting HTML to JPG. In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process step by step. You'll learn about the prerequisites, how to import packages, and break down each example into multiple steps to master HTML to JPG conversion with Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install it from the Java website.

2. Aspose.HTML for Java Library: You need to have Aspose.HTML for Java library installed. If you haven't done so already, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

## Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary Aspose.HTML packages into your Java project. You can do this using the following code:

```java
import com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument;
import com.aspose.html.saving.ImageSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.html.rendering.image.ImageFormat;
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
```

Now, let's break down the HTML to JPG conversion process into multiple steps:

## Prepare the HTML Code

First, prepare the HTML code that you want to convert to a JPG image. You can do this by creating an HTML file or a string containing HTML code.

```java
String code = "<span>Hello</span> <span>World!!</span>";
try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("document.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(code);
}
```

## Initialize the HTML Document

Next, you need to initialize an HTML document from the HTML file you just created. This is done using the Aspose.HTML library.

```java
HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument("document.html");
```

## Configure ImageSaveOptions

Now, configure the `ImageSaveOptions` to specify the format you want to save the image in. In this case, we are converting to JPEG.

```java
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Jpeg);
```

## Convert HTML to JPG

The final step is to convert the HTML document to a JPG image using the specified options.

```java
Converter.convertHTML(document, options, "output.jpg");
```

## Cleanup

Don't forget to release the resources once you're done with the conversion.

```java
if (document != null) {
    document.dispose();
}
```

Congratulations! You've successfully converted HTML to JPG using Aspose.HTML for Java.
