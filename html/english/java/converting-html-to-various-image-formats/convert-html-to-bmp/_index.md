## Converting HTML to BMP

This is the heart of our tutorial, where you'll convert an HTML document into a BMP image. Follow these steps to accomplish this task:

### Step 4: Prepare HTML Code

First, prepare the HTML code that you want to convert. Here's an example:

```java
String code = "<span>Hello</span> <span>World!!</span>";
```

### Step 5: Save HTML to a File

Save the HTML code to a file using a `FileWriter`. This code snippet demonstrates how:

```java
try (java.io.FileWriter fileWriter = new java.io.FileWriter("document.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(code);
}
```

### Step 6: Initialize an HTML Document

Initialize an HTML document from the HTML file you just created:

```java
HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument("document.html");
```

### Step 7: Convert HTML to BMP

Initialize ImageSaveOptions and use Converter to convert HTML to BMP. Specify the output file for the BMP image:

```java
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(com.aspose.html.rendering.image.ImageFormat.Bmp);
Converter.convertHTML(document, options, "output.bmp");
```

### Step 8: Dispose of Resources

Finally, make sure to release any resources that were used during the conversion:

```java
if (document != null) {
    document.dispose();
}
```

With these steps completed, you've successfully converted an HTML document to a BMP image using Aspose.HTML for Java!
