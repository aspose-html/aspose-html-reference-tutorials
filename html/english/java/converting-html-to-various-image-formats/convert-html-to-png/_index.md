# HTML to PNG Conversion with Aspose.HTML for Java


In the world of web development, the ability to convert HTML content to other formats is often a crucial task. One common requirement is to transform HTML into an image format like PNG. Aspose.HTML for Java provides a powerful solution for accomplishing this task with ease. In this step-by-step tutorial, we will guide you through the process of converting HTML to PNG using Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started with the actual conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your system.

- Aspose.HTML for Java: You should have the Aspose.HTML for Java library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.HTML for Java documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/html/java/).

- HTML Content: Prepare the HTML content that you want to convert to a PNG image.

- Basic Java Knowledge: You should have a basic understanding of Java programming.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, you need to import the necessary packages from Aspose.HTML for Java to perform HTML to PNG conversion. Here's how you can import the required packages:

```java
import com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument;
import com.aspose.html.saving.ImageSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
import com.aspose.html.rendering.image.ImageFormat;
```

## Prepare the HTML Content

To begin, you should prepare the HTML content that you want to convert to a PNG image. You can use any HTML code as per your requirements.

```java
String htmlCode = "<span>Hello</span> <span>World!!</span>";
```

You can save this HTML code to a file for further processing. In this example, we are saving it to a file named "document.html."

```java
try (java.io.FileWriter fileWriter = new java.io.FileWriter("document.html")) {
    fileWriter.write(htmlCode);
}
```

## Initialize an HTML Document

Next, you need to initialize an HTML document from the HTML file you created in the previous step.

```java
HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument("document.html");
```

## Convert HTML to PNG

Now, it's time to set up the conversion options and perform the HTML to PNG conversion.

```java
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Png);
Converter.convertHTML(document, options, "output.png");
```

## Cleanup

Don't forget to release any resources and clean up after the conversion is complete.

```java
if (document != null) {
    document.dispose();
}
```

Congratulations! You've successfully converted HTML to PNG using Aspose.HTML for Java. You can now use the generated PNG image as needed in your projects.
