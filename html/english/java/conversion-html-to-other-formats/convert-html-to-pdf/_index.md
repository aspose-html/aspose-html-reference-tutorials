# HTML to PDF Conversion with Aspose.HTML for Java

In the digital age, the need to convert HTML content to PDF files is a common requirement for various applications. Whether it's for archiving web pages, generating reports, or creating printable documents, having a reliable and efficient tool is crucial. Aspose.HTML for Java offers a powerful solution for this task. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of converting HTML to PDF using Aspose.HTML for Java. But before we dive into the details, let's take a look at the prerequisites you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin converting HTML to PDF with Aspose.HTML for Java, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: You should have a Java development environment set up on your system. If you haven't already, download and install the latest version of Java Development Kit (JDK) from the Oracle website.

2. Aspose.HTML for Java: You need to acquire the Aspose.HTML for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/). Make sure to include the library in your project.

3. HTML Document to Convert: You must have the HTML document that you want to convert to PDF. If you don't have one, you can create a simple HTML file or use an existing one.

Now that you have the necessary prerequisites in place, let's move on to the steps involved in converting HTML to PDF using Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Import Packages

To get started with the conversion process, you need to import the required packages and classes from the Aspose.HTML for Java library. Here are the necessary imports:

```java
import com.aspose.html.HTMLDocument;
import com.aspose.html.saving.PdfSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
```

## Step 1: Load the HTML Document

The first step in converting HTML to PDF is to load the HTML document that you want to convert. You can do this using the following code:

```java
HTMLDocument htmlDocument = new HTMLDocument("path/to/your/input.html");
```

In this code, replace `"path/to/your/input.html"` with the actual file path of your HTML document.

## Step 2: Initialize PDF Save Options

Next, you'll need to initialize the PDF save options. These options allow you to customize various settings for the PDF output, such as JPEG quality. Here's how you can do it:

```java
PdfSaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions();
options.setJpegQuality(100);
```

You can adjust the `jpegQuality` value as per your requirements. A higher value results in better image quality but may increase the file size.

## Step 3: Define the Output Path

Before converting, specify the path where you want to save the generated PDF file. Replace `"path/to/your/output.pdf"` with your desired file path:

```java
String outputPDF = "path/to/your/output.pdf";
```

## Step 4: Convert HTML to PDF

Now, it's time to perform the actual conversion. Aspose.HTML for Java makes it a breeze with the following code:

```java
Converter.convertHTML(htmlDocument, options, outputPDF);
```

This code takes the loaded HTML document, PDF save options, and output path as parameters to execute the conversion.

With these four steps, you can effortlessly convert your HTML document to a PDF file using Aspose.HTML for Java.
