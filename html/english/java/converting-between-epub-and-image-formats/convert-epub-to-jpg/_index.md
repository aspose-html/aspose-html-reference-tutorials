# Convert EPUB to JPG with Aspose.HTML for Java

In this step-by-step tutorial, we will guide you through the process of converting an EPUB file to JPG format using Aspose.HTML for Java. Aspose.HTML is a powerful library that allows you to work with HTML and various formats, making it an excellent choice for handling EPUB conversions. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.HTML for Java
You will need to have Aspose.HTML for Java installed. You can download it from the website [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

2. Java Development Environment
Ensure that you have Java installed on your system and a development environment set up.

Now that you have the prerequisites in order, let's dive into the conversion process.

## Step 1: Import Packages

The first step is to import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.HTML for Java. Add the following code to your Java file:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import com.aspose.html.saving.ImageSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.html.rendering.image.ImageFormat;
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
```

## Step 2: Converting EPUB to JPG

In this step, we will open an existing EPUB file and convert it to JPG format.

```java
try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("input.epub")) {
    // Initialize ImageSaveOptions
    ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Jpeg);
    
    // Call the ConvertEPUB method to convert the EPUB file to JPG.
    Converter.convertEPUB(fileInputStream, options, "output.jpg");
}
```

In this code snippet:

- We open the EPUB file using a `FileInputStream`.
- We create `ImageSaveOptions` and specify the format as JPG.
- Finally, we call the `convertEPUB` method to perform the conversion. The output will be saved as "output.jpg."
