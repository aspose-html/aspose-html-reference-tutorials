# Convert EPUB to TIFF with Aspose.HTML for Java

In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of converting EPUB files to TIFF images using Aspose.HTML for Java. Aspose.HTML is a powerful HTML manipulation and conversion library that allows you to work with various file formats, including EPUB and TIFF. This tutorial will provide you with the prerequisites, code examples, and detailed steps to successfully convert your EPUB files to TIFF images.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment
Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download and install it from the Oracle website.

2. Aspose.HTML for Java
You need to have Aspose.HTML for Java library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/).

3. EPUB File
You should have an EPUB file that you want to convert to TIFF format.

Now that you have the prerequisites in order, let's move on to the steps to convert EPUB to TIFF using Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Step 1: Import Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages from the Aspose.HTML library. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import com.aspose.html.saving.ImageSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.html.rendering.image.ImageFormat;
import com.aspose.html.converters.Converter;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
```

## Step 2: Converting EPUB to TIFF

Now, let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps.

### Step 2.1: Open the EPUB File

You need to open an existing EPUB file for reading. Replace `"input.epub"` with the path to your EPUB file.

```java
try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("input.epub")) {
```

### Step 2.2: Initialize ImageSaveOptions

Initialize the `ImageSaveOptions` with the desired image format (TIFF in this case).

```java
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Tiff);
```

### Step 2.3: Convert EPUB to TIFF

Call the `convertEPUB` method to convert the EPUB file to TIFF. Specify the input stream, options, and the output path for the TIFF file.

```java
Converter.convertEPUB(fileInputStream, options, "output.tiff");
```

That's it! You have successfully converted an EPUB file to a TIFF image using Aspose.HTML for Java. You can find the converted TIFF file at the specified output path.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to convert EPUB files to TIFF images using Aspose.HTML for Java. With the right prerequisites and the provided code examples, you can easily integrate this functionality into your Java applications.
