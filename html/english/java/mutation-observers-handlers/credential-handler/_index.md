# Using Credential Handler in Aspose.HTML for Java

## Introduction
When working with web applications that require user credentials for authentication, managing those credentials effectively is crucial. That’s where Aspose.HTML for Java comes into play, providing tools to streamline this process. In this guide, we'll delve into how to implement a Credential Handler with Aspose.HTML for Java, ensuring secure operations in your applications.
## Prerequisites
Before jumping into the implementation, it’s essential to ensure you have everything set up correctly. Let’s go over what you need:
### 1. Java Development Environment
- Make sure you have JDK installed on your machine. A good IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse can facilitate your coding journey.
### 2. Aspose.HTML for Java
- Download the Aspose.HTML for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/). This library will provide all necessary functionalities to work with HTML and web resources.
### 3. Basic Knowledge of Java
- Familiarity with Java programming, Object-Oriented principles, and networking concepts will be beneficial.
### 4. Access to Credentials
- Ensure you have valid user credentials for testing. For security reasons, do not store them in plain text.
## Import Packages
Let’s start by importing the necessary packages that your Java file will require. Here’s how you can set it up:
```java
import com.aspose.html.net.INetworkOperationContext;
import com.aspose.html.net.MessageHandler;
```
With the required packages imported, you are now ready to implement a credential handler. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating one.
## Step 1: Create a Custom Credential Handler Class
In this step, you will create a new Java class that extends the `MessageHandler` abstract class.
```java
public class CredentialHandler extends MessageHandler {
    ...
}
```
This class will override the `invoke` method, enabling you to modify how network requests are handled.
## Step 2: Override the `invoke` Method
You’ll need to implement the logic for handling network requests and credentials within this method.
```java
@Override
public void invoke(INetworkOperationContext context) {
    // Setting credentials
    context.getRequest().setCredentials(new com.aspose.ms.System.Net.NetworkCredential("username", "securelystoredpassword"));
    context.getRequest().setPreAuthenticate(true);
    
    // Call the next handler in the pipeline
    invoke(context);
}
```
In this snippet, you are specifying the credentials dynamically. However, keep in mind that securely storing passwords is essential in real applications.
## Step 3: Using the Credential Handler
Now that you have your `CredentialHandler`, it’s time to integrate it into your application.
You can create an instance of `CredentialHandler` and use it when making network requests.
```java
public class HtmlDocumentLoader {
    public void loadDocument(String url) {
        CredentialHandler credentialHandler = new CredentialHandler();
        INetworkOperationContext operationContext = new NetworkOperationContext();
        
        // Set the URL you wish to access.
        operationContext.getRequest().setUrl(url);
        
        credentialHandler.invoke(operationContext);
    
        // Continue with your operation...
    }
}
```
## Step 4: Testing Your Implementation
After setting up your credential handler, it’s essential to test if it works correctly.
Create a main method for testing purposes. Here’s an example:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HtmlDocumentLoader loader = new HtmlDocumentLoader();
        loader.loadDocument("http://example.com");
    }
}
```
Run your application and ensure that the handler processes authentication requests as expected. Watch for any errors or issues in the console output.
## Conclusion
Implementing a Credential Handler in Aspose.HTML for Java takes a bit of configuration, but it streamlines the way your applications handle user authentication. Leveraging the powerful features of Aspose, you can ensure that your applications remain secure while interacting with web resources.
