## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of Aspose.HTML for .NET, there are a few prerequisites you should have in place:

1. Development Environment: Ensure that you have a working development environment for .NET. You should have Visual Studio or any other .NET IDE installed on your system.

2. Aspose.HTML Library: Download the Aspose.HTML for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/). Install it in your project.

3. License: You'll need a license to use Aspose.HTML for .NET in your applications. You can obtain a temporary license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) or purchase a full license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

Now that you have the prerequisites in place, let's explore some of the essential namespaces and dive into hands-on examples.

## Import Namespaces

In any .NET project, you start by importing the necessary namespaces to access the functionality provided by Aspose.HTML. Here are some key namespaces you'll often use:

```csharp
using Aspose.Html;
using Aspose.Html.Converters;
using Aspose.Html.Dom;
using Aspose.Html.Rendering.Image;
```

These namespaces cover a wide range of HTML-related tasks, including document manipulation, rendering, and conversion.

## Rendering SVG as PNG

Let's start with a practical example of rendering an SVG document as a PNG image.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
using (var document = new Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.SVGDocument("<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><circle cx='50' cy='50' r='40'/></svg>", @"c:\work\"))
{
    using (SvgRenderer renderer = new SvgRenderer())
    using (ImageDevice device = new ImageDevice(dataDir + @"document_out.png"))
    {
        renderer.Render(device, document);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. We specify the data directory where the output image will be saved.

2. We create an instance of `SVGDocument` by providing the SVG content and the base URI.

3. Next, we use `SvgRenderer` and `ImageDevice` to render the SVG document as a PNG image.

4. The resulting PNG image is saved in the specified data directory.

This example showcases how Aspose.HTML for .NET can simplify complex tasks like SVG to PNG conversion. You can apply similar principles to various HTML-related operations.

## Conclusion

Aspose.HTML for .NET is a versatile library that empowers .NET developers to work seamlessly with HTML documents. With the right prerequisites in place and a solid understanding of the provided namespaces and examples, you can unlock the full potential of this library for your projects.
