# Convert EPUB to PDF in .NET with Aspose.HTML


In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Aspose.HTML for .NET to convert EPUB files to PDF. Aspose.HTML is a powerful .NET library that provides various functionalities for working with HTML and EPUB documents. We will cover the prerequisites, import necessary namespaces, and break down multiple examples, explaining each step in detail.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.HTML for .NET: Ensure you have Aspose.HTML for .NET installed in your .NET project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/).

2. Your Data Directory: You will need a data directory where your EPUB files are stored.

Now, let's dive into the step-by-step process of converting EPUB to PDF using Aspose.HTML for .NET.

## Convert EPUB to PDF

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Make sure you have a .NET project set up, and Aspose.HTML for .NET is installed.

### Step 2: Import Required Namespaces

In your C# code file, import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Html.Saving;
using Aspose.Html.Converters;
```

### Step 3: Open the EPUB File

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
using (var stream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(dataDir + "input.epub"))
{
    // Continue to the next step...
}
```

- Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual directory where your EPUB file is located.
- This code opens the EPUB file for reading.

### Step 4: Set PDF Options and Perform Conversion

```csharp
var options = new PdfSaveOptions();
Converter.ConvertEPUB(stream, options, "output.pdf");
```

- Create an instance of `PdfSaveOptions` to specify PDF conversion settings.
- Use the `Converter.ConvertEPUB` method to convert the EPUB to PDF with the given options.
- Save the resulting PDF as "output.pdf."

## Specify PDF Save Options

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Ensure you have a .NET project set up and Aspose.HTML for .NET installed.

### Step 2: Import Required Namespaces

Import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:

```csharp
using Aspose.Html.Saving;
using Aspose.Html.Converters;
using Aspose.Html.IO;
using Aspose.Html.Drawing;
```

### Step 3: Open the EPUB File

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
using (var stream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(dataDir + "input.epub"))
{
    // Continue to the next step...
}
```

- Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual directory of your EPUB file.
- Open the EPUB file for reading.

### Step 4: Customize PDF Options

```csharp
var options = new PdfSaveOptions()
{
    PageSetup = { AnyPage = new Page() { Size = Size.FromPixels(3000, 1000) } },
    BackgroundColor = System.Drawing.Color.AliceBlue
};
```

- Create an instance of `PdfSaveOptions` and customize it as per your requirements.
- In this example, we set the page size to 3000 pixels width and 1000 pixels height, and the background color to Alice Blue.

### Step 5: Perform Conversion

```csharp
Converter.ConvertEPUB(stream, options, "output.pdf");
```

- Use the `Converter.ConvertEPUB` method to convert the EPUB to PDF with the custom options.
- Save the resulting PDF as "output.pdf."

## Use Custom Stream Provider

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Set up a .NET project and install Aspose.HTML for .NET.

### Step 2: Import Required Namespaces

In your C# code, import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Html.Saving;
using Aspose.Html.Converters;
using Aspose.Html.IO;
```

### Step 3: Open the EPUB File

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
using (var stream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(dataDir + "input.epub"))
{
    // Continue to the next step...
}
```

- Replace `"Your Data Directory"` with the actual directory of your EPUB file.
- Open the EPUB file for reading.

### Step 4: Use a Custom Stream Provider

```csharp
using (var streamProvider = new MemoryStreamProvider())
{
    Converter.ConvertEPUB(stream, new PdfSaveOptions(), streamProvider);

    // Continue to the next step...
}
```

- Create a `MemoryStreamProvider` to manage the conversion result as a memory stream.
- Use the `Converter.ConvertEPUB` method with the custom stream provider.

### Step 5: Save the Result

```csharp
var memory = streamProvider.Streams.First();
memory.Seek(0, System.IO.SeekOrigin.Begin);

using (System.IO.FileStream fs = System.IO.File.Create("output.pdf"))
{
    memory.CopyTo(fs);
}
```

- Access the memory stream containing the converted data.
- Set the stream position to the beginning.
- Create an output PDF file and copy the content from the memory stream to it.

### Class MemoryStreamProvider source code. 

```csharp
class MemoryStreamProvider : Aspose.Html.IO.ICreateStreamProvider
        {
            // List of MemoryStream objects created during the document rendering
            public List<System.IO.MemoryStream> Streams { get; } = new List<System.IO.MemoryStream>();
            public System.IO.Stream GetStream(string name, string extension)
            {
                // This method is called when the only one output stream is required, for instance for XPS, PDF or TIFF formats.
                System.IO.MemoryStream result = new System.IO.MemoryStream();
                Streams.Add(result);
                return result;
            }
            public System.IO.Stream GetStream(string name, string extension, int page)
            {
                // This method is called when the creation of multiple output streams are required. For instance during the rendering HTML to list of the image files (JPG, PNG, etc.)
                System.IO.MemoryStream result = new System.IO.MemoryStream();
                Streams.Add(result);
                return result;
            }
            public void ReleaseStream(System.IO.Stream stream)
            {
                //  Here You can release the stream filled with data and, for instance, flush it to the hard-drive
            }
            public void Dispose()
            {
                // Releasing resources
                foreach (var stream in Streams)
                    stream.Dispose();
            }
        }
```
