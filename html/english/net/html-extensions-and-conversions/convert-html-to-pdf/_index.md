### Step 3: Configure PDF Save Options

Initialize the `PdfSaveOptions` to define the settings for PDF conversion, such as image quality and page layout. In this example, we set the JPEG quality to 100.

```csharp

### Step 4: Define the Output Path

```csharp
string outputPDF = dataDir + "HTMLtoPDF_Output.pdf";
