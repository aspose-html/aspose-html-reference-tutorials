# Convert HTML to Markdown in .NET with Aspose.HTML


## Introduction

In today's digital age, web content is vital, and so is the ability to manipulate and convert it efficiently. Aspose.HTML for .NET is a powerful library that simplifies HTML document processing, allowing you to convert HTML content into various formats with ease. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of using Aspose.HTML for .NET to convert HTML to Markdown format.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.HTML for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.HTML for .NET library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/). You will need this library to work through the examples.

2. A Development Environment: Ensure that you have a .NET development environment set up, including Visual Studio or any other suitable code editor.

3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will be helpful in understanding and implementing the examples.

## Import Namespace

To get started, you need to import the Aspose.HTML namespace into your C# project. This allows you to access the classes and methods required for HTML to Markdown conversion.

### Step 1: Import the Aspose.HTML Namespace

```csharp
using Aspose.Html;
```

With the namespace imported, you can now proceed with HTML to Markdown conversion.

## Convert HTML to Markdown in .NET with Aspose.HTML

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to convert an HTML document to Markdown using Aspose.HTML for .NET. 

### Step 1: Create an HTMLDocument

Begin by creating an HTML document using Aspose.HTML. In this example, we have a simple HTML content with two paragraphs.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
using (var document = new Aspose.Html.HTMLDocument("<p>my first paragraph</p>" +
"<p>my second paragraph</p>", dataDir))
{
    // Your code will go here
}
```

### Step 2: Save as Markdown

Now, let's save the HTML content as Markdown. In this step, we use the `Saving.HTMLSaveFormat.Markdown` option to specify the format.

```csharp
document.Save(dataDir + "Markdown.md", Saving.HTMLSaveFormat.Markdown);
```

Congratulations! You've successfully converted an HTML document to Markdown using Aspose.HTML for .NET.

## Define Markdown Conversion Rules

Sometimes, you may want to customize the Markdown conversion rules to include or exclude specific HTML elements. In this example, we will define rules for converting only selected elements.

### Step 1: Define Markdown Rules

First, create an HTML document as shown in the previous example. Then, create a `MarkdownSaveOptions` object to specify the conversion rules.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
using (var document = new Aspose.Html.HTMLDocument("<p>my first paragraph</p>", dataDir))
{
    var options = new Aspose.Html.Saving.MarkdownSaveOptions();
    
    // Set the rules: only <a>, <img>, and <p> elements will be converted to markdown.
    options.Features = MarkdownFeatures.Link | MarkdownFeatures.Image | MarkdownFeatures.AutomaticParagraph;
    
    document.Save(dataDir + "Markdown.md", options);
}
```

By following this step, you can control the specific HTML elements that are converted to Markdown.
