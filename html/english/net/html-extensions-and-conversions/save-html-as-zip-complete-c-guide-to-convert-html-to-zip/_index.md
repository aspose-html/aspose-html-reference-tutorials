# Save HTML as ZIP – Complete C# Guide to Convert HTML to ZIP

Ever needed to **save HTML as ZIP** but weren’t sure which API calls to chain together? You’re not alone. Many developers hit a wall when they want to bundle an HTML page together with its CSS, images, and fonts into a single archive—especially when they want the whole thing to stay in memory until they decide what to do with it.  

The good news? With Aspose.HTML you can **convert HTML to ZIP** in a handful of lines, thanks to the `HtmlSaveOptions` class and a **custom resource handler** that gives you total control over where each resource ends up. In this tutorial we’ll walk through the exact steps to **render HTML to ZIP**, store everything in memory, and optionally write the files out to disk. By the end you’ll have a reusable snippet you can drop into any .NET project.

## What This Tutorial Covers

* How to define the HTML source string (or load it from a file).  
* How to instantiate an `HTMLDocument` with Aspose.HTML.  
* How to create a **custom resource handler** that returns a `MemoryStream` for each resource.  
* How to configure `HtmlSaveOptions` to generate a **ZIP archive** containing the HTML and all its dependent files.  
* How to save the document and, if you like, write the in‑memory data to a folder on disk.  

No external tools, no manual zipping—just pure C# and Aspose.HTML.  

> **Pro tip:** If you’re already using Aspose.PDF or Aspose.Words, the same `ResourceHandler` pattern works there too, so you can reuse this code across multiple document types.

---

## Step 1: Save HTML as ZIP – Define the HTML Source

First we need a string that holds the HTML we want to archive. In a real project you might read this from a file, a database, or an API response, but for clarity we’ll hard‑code a tiny example.

```csharp
// Step 1: HTML source to render.
string htmlContent = "<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1>Hello World</h1></body></html>";
```

> **Why this matters:** The `HTMLDocument` constructor expects either a file path or raw HTML. Supplying the string directly keeps the whole process in memory, which is perfect when you later want to stream the ZIP directly to a client.

---

## Step 2: Convert HTML to ZIP – Load the HTMLDocument

Now we hand the HTML string to Aspose.HTML. The second argument (`"."`) tells the library where to resolve relative URLs; using the current directory works for most simple cases.

```csharp
// Step 2: Load HTML into a document.
using (var htmlDoc = new HTMLDocument(htmlContent, "."))
{
    // The rest of the steps go inside this block.
```

> **What’s happening:** `HTMLDocument` parses the markup, builds a DOM, and prepares all linked resources (CSS, images, fonts) for rendering. Wrapping it in a `using` block guarantees proper disposal of native resources.

---

## Step 3: Render HTML to ZIP – Create a Custom Resource Handler

Aspose.HTML lets you decide **where** each resource is written. By subclassing `ResourceHandler` we can hand back a fresh `MemoryStream` for every file that the renderer needs to save.

```csharp
    // Step 3: Custom handler that stores resources in memory.
    var resourceHandler = new MyResourceHandler();
```

> **Why a custom handler?** The default behavior writes files to the file system. With a handler you can keep everything in RAM, push the ZIP straight to a web response, or even encrypt the streams on the fly.

---

## Step 4: Convert HTML to ZIP – Configure Save Options

Here’s the heart of the operation. `HtmlSaveOptions` tells Aspose.HTML to bundle everything into a ZIP archive (`SaveToArchive = true`) and to use our `resourceHandler` for storage.

```csharp
    // Step 4: Configure save options to create a ZIP archive.
    var saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions
    {
        OutputStorage = resourceHandler,   // directs output to our handler
        SaveToArchive = true,              // enables ZIP creation
        ArchiveFileName = "result.zip"     // name of the archive inside the stream
    };
```

> **Key insight:** `ArchiveFileName` is the name that will appear inside the ZIP, not a path on disk. Because we’re using a memory‑based handler, the ZIP lives entirely in RAM until we decide what to do with it.

---

## Step 5: Save HTML as ZIP – Persist the Archive

Finally, we ask the document to save itself using the options we just built. This call triggers the rendering pipeline, calls our handler for each resource, and writes the final ZIP to the memory streams we provided.

```csharp
    // Step 5: Save the document.
    htmlDoc.Save(saveOptions);
}
```

> **Result:** At this point `resourceHandler` holds a `MemoryStream` for the main HTML file, plus additional streams for any CSS, images, or fonts that were referenced. The ZIP file is fully assembled inside those streams.

---

## Step 6: Custom Resource Handler – Provide a Stream for Each Resource

Below is the implementation of `MyResourceHandler`. The `HandleResource` method is called once per resource (HTML, CSS, images, fonts, …). We simply hand back a new `MemoryStream` each time.

```csharp
public class MyResourceHandler : ResourceHandler
{
    // Provide a stream for each resource.
    public override Stream HandleResource(ResourceInfo info) => new MemoryStream();
```

> **Why a fresh stream?** Each resource needs its own container; reusing a single stream would corrupt the archive. `MemoryStream` is cheap and automatically grows as needed.

---

## Step 7: Optional – Write Saved Resources to Disk

If you’d like to inspect the generated files or keep a copy on the server, `ResourceSaved` is called after a stream is closed. Here we write the in‑memory content to a folder you specify (`YOUR_DIRECTORY/Output`).

```csharp
    // After saving, write the in‑memory data to disk.
    public override void ResourceSaved(ResourceInfo info, Stream stream)
    {
        string outPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DIRECTORY/Output", info.FileName);
        Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(outPath));
        using (var file = File.Create(outPath))
        {
            stream.Position = 0;        // rewind to the beginning
            stream.CopyTo(file);        // dump the data to disk
        }
    }
}
```

> **Edge case note:** If you’re running in an environment without write permissions (e.g., Azure Functions), simply skip the `ResourceSaved` implementation or replace it with a cloud‑storage upload.

## Full, Runnable Example (38 Lines)

Below is the complete code ready to paste into a console app. It respects the 15‑40 line limit, uses descriptive variable names, and includes placeholders you can adjust.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Html;
using Aspose.Html.Rendering;

// Step 1: HTML source to render.
string htmlContent = "<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1>Hello World</h1></body></html>";

// Step 2: Load HTML into a document.
using (var htmlDoc = new HTMLDocument(htmlContent, "."))
{
    // Step 3: Custom handler that stores resources in memory.
    var resourceHandler = new MyResourceHandler();
    // Step 4: Configure save options to create a ZIP archive.
    var saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions
    {
        OutputStorage = resourceHandler,
        SaveToArchive = true,
        ArchiveFileName = "result.zip"
    };
    // Step 5: Save the document.
    htmlDoc.Save(saveOptions);
}

// -----------------------------------------------------------------
public class MyResourceHandler : ResourceHandler
{
    // Provide a stream for each resource.
    public override Stream HandleResource(ResourceInfo info) => new MemoryStream();
    // After saving, write the in‑memory data to disk.
    public override void ResourceSaved(ResourceInfo info, Stream stream)
    {
        string outPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DIRECTORY/Output", info.FileName);
        Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(outPath));
        using (var file = File.Create(outPath))
        {
            stream.Position = 0;
            stream.CopyTo(file);
        }
    }
}
```

### Expected Output

* A `result.zip` file appears inside the in‑memory archive (you can retrieve it from `resourceHandler` if you add a property to expose the stream).  
* If you kept the `ResourceSaved` implementation, the same files are also written to `YOUR_DIRECTORY/Output` on disk, mirroring the ZIP’s internal structure.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Does this work with large HTML pages?**  
A: Absolutely. `MemoryStream` expands as needed, but for multi‑megabyte pages you might want to stream directly to a `FileStream` to avoid high memory pressure. Just change `HandleResource` to return `File.Create(Path.Combine("temp", info.FileName))`.

**Q: Can I encrypt the ZIP?**  
A: Aspose.HTML doesn’t provide built‑in encryption, but after you retrieve the `MemoryStream` you can feed it to `System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive` with a password, or use a third‑party library like SharpZipLib.

**Q: What about relative URLs inside the HTML?**  
A: The second argument to `HTMLDocument` (`"."`) tells Aspose.HTML to resolve relative paths against the current directory. If your resources live elsewhere, pass the appropriate base path or a custom `UriResolver`.

## Conclusion

We’ve just shown how to **save HTML as ZIP** using Aspose.HTML, a **custom resource handler**, and a few straightforward configuration steps. The approach lets you **convert HTML to ZIP** entirely in memory, giving you the flexibility to stream the result to a web client, store it in a database, or write it to disk for later use.  

Feel free to experiment: swap `MemoryStream` for a cloud storage stream, add password protection, or batch‑process dozens of pages in parallel. The core pattern—load, handle, configure, save—remains the same, making this a reusable building block for any .NET solution that needs to **render HTML to ZIP** or **create ZIP from HTML**.
