# Convert HTML to MHTML in .NET with Aspose.HTML


In the world of web development, efficient document conversion is crucial. The Aspose.HTML for .NET library is a powerful tool that simplifies the conversion of HTML documents into various formats, including MHTML. MHTML, short for "MIME HTML," is a web page archive format that allows you to save a webpage and its resources in a single file. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of converting an HTML document to MHTML using Aspose.HTML for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. Aspose.HTML for .NET Library

You need to have the Aspose.HTML for .NET library installed. If you haven't done this already, you can download it from the website [here](https://releases.aspose.com/html/net/). Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

### 2. Sample HTML Document

To perform the conversion, you'll need an HTML document to work with. Ensure you have a sample HTML file ready. You can use your own HTML document or download a sample from the [Aspose.HTML documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/).

Now that you have the prerequisites in place, let's proceed with the conversion.

## Import Namespace

First, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your C# code. This is essential to access the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.HTML library.

### Import the Required Namespace

```csharp
using Aspose.Html;
```

Now that you've imported the necessary namespace, you can move on to the actual conversion process.

We'll break down the conversion of an HTML document to MHTML into several steps for clarity.

## Load the HTML Document

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory"; // Specify your data directory
HTMLDocument htmlDocument = new HTMLDocument(dataDir + "input.html"); // Load the HTML document
```

In this step, you provide the path to your HTML document. Aspose.HTML loads the HTML file, making it ready for conversion.

## Initialize MHTMLSaveOptions

```csharp
MHTMLSaveOptions options = new MHTMLSaveOptions();
```

Here, you initialize the `MHTMLSaveOptions` class, which provides options for the MHTML conversion.

## Set Resource Handling Rules

```csharp
options.ResourceHandlingOptions.MaxHandlingDepth = 1;
```

You can set resource handling rules based on your requirements. In this example, we limit the maximum handling depth to 1, which means only the main HTML document and its immediate resources will be included in the MHTML file.

## Specify the Output Path

```csharp
string outputMHTML = dataDir + "HTMLtoMHTML_Output.mht"; // Specify the output file path
```

In this step, you specify the path for the resulting MHTML file. This is where the converted MHTML document will be saved.

## Perform the Conversion

```csharp
Converter.ConvertHTML(htmlDocument, options, outputMHTML);
```

Now, it's time to convert the HTML document to MHTML. The `ConvertHTML` method takes the loaded HTML document, the options you've set, and the output file path as parameters.

Congratulations! You've successfully converted an HTML document to MHTML using Aspose.HTML for .NET. You can now access the MHTML file at the specified output path.

## Conclusion

Efficiently converting HTML documents to MHTML format is a valuable skill for web developers and content creators. Aspose.HTML for .NET simplifies this process, making it accessible and user-friendly. By following the step-by-step guide outlined above, you can effortlessly create MHTML archives of your web content.

Now, let's address some frequently asked questions (FAQs) to provide further clarity on this topic.
