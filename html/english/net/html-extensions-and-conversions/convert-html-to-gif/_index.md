## Import Namespace

To start working with Aspose.HTML for .NET, you need to import the required namespaces. Here's how you can do it:

### Import the Aspose.HTML Namespace

You need to include the Aspose.HTML namespace in your code to access its classes and methods. This is typically done at the beginning of your C# file.

## Converting HTML to GIF in .NET

Now, let's get to the heart of the matter â€“ converting an HTML document to a GIF using Aspose.HTML for .NET. This process is broken down into multiple steps to make it easy to follow.

### Load the HTML Document

First, you need to load the HTML document you want to convert. Make sure you've placed the HTML file in your data directory. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Data Directory";
HTMLDocument htmlDocument = new HTMLDocument(dataDir + "input.html");
```

In this code, `dataDir` should point to the directory where your HTML document is located. `HTMLDocument` is an essential class provided by Aspose.HTML for document loading and manipulation.

### Initialize ImageSaveOptions

Now, you need to initialize the `ImageSaveOptions`. This is an important step as it defines the format in which you want to save the HTML as an image (in this case, GIF).

```csharp
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Gif);
```

Here, we specify that the output should be in GIF format. Aspose.HTML offers support for various image formats, making it highly versatile.

### Specify the Output File Path

To complete the conversion, you need to specify the path where the output GIF file will be saved.

```csharp
string outputFile = dataDir + "HTMLtoGIF_Output.gif";
```

Make sure to specify the directory where you want to save the converted GIF.

### Convert HTML to GIF

The final step involves actually converting the HTML document to a GIF. This is where the magic happens:

```csharp
Converter.ConvertHTML(htmlDocument, options, outputFile);
```

The `Converter` class is provided by Aspose.HTML to perform the conversion. It takes the HTML document, image format options, and the output file path as parameters.

Congratulations! You've successfully converted an HTML document to a GIF using Aspose.HTML for .NET. This comprehensive guide has taken you through each step, ensuring you have a clear understanding of the process.
